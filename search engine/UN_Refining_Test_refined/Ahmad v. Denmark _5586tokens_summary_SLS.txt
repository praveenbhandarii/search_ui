Case Details:

- Case Name: Kashif Ahmad v. Denmark
- Case ID: Communication No. 15/2003
- Court: United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination (UN CERD)
- Document Details: Views adopted by the Committee under article 14 of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (ICERD)
- Case Summary: The case involves Kashif Ahmad, a Pakistani national, who alleges racial discrimination by Danish nationals Mr. O.T. and Mr. K.P. at Avedore High School in Denmark on June 22, 1998. The author claims that racist expressions were used against him and his brother, including being called "a bunch of monkeys" and being told they couldn't express themselves correctly. The author's counsel requested the police to bring the case before the State Attorney, but this was denied. The High Court of the Eastern Circuit held that an incident of racial discrimination does not imply a violation of honor and reputation under the Danish Act on Tort. The author's counsel argues that the national authorities did not properly examine the case and that the author never received an apology or sufficient satisfaction or reparation.
