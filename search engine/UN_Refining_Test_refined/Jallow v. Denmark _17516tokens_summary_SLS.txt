Combined Summary:

Case Details:
The case, A v. Denmark, was brought before the United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination (UN CERD) in March 2019. The author, A, alleges that Denmark violated articles 4(a), 3.1(c), and 6 of the International Convention on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination by allowing exhibitions that incited racial discrimination and hatred to take place and by refusing to prosecute the organizers. The author argues that the decision to stop the investigation constitutes a violation of article 4(a) of the Convention, as it reveals a failure to effectively investigate hate crimes falling under article 266 of the Criminal Code.

The key parties involved are the author, A, and the State party, Denmark. The jurisdiction lies with the UN CERD, which is responsible for monitoring the implementation of the Convention.

Legal Analysis and Reasoning:
The author relies on articles 4(a), 3.1(c), and 6 of the International Convention on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination to argue that Denmark violated their rights.
