Summary:

Case Details:
The case, Gelle vs Denmark, was brought before the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination (CERD) by Mr. Gelle against Denmark. The case ID is unknown, and the document details are Communication No. 45/2007. The key parties involved are Mr. Gelle as the petitioner and Denmark as the respondent. The case is related to the issue of racial discrimination in Denmark, specifically concerning the rights of individuals of Somali origin. The incident mentioned in the complaint dates back to 1998, and the complainant's statement was made in a newspaper interview. The case highlights the importance of effective investigations into allegations of racial discrimination and the role of politicians and members of political parties in promoting the Convention's provisions.

Procedural History:
The document does not provide specific dates for the procedural history. However, it mentions that the document was adopted on 21 August 2009. The jurisdiction and competence lie with the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination (CERD).

Legal Analysis and Reasoning:
The petitioner alleges that Denmark's failure to investigate a hate speech incident and its denial of his right to appeal violate article 2, paragraph 1(d), and article 6 of the CERD. The petitioner also claims that Denmark breached its obligation under article 4 of the CERD to take effective action against hate speech targeting Somalis in Denmark. The respondent argues that the petitioner did not exhaust domestic remedies as he reported the statements to the authorities after they were published on a website. The Committee considered the State party's argument that the petitioner did not exhaust domestic remedies with respect to part of her statement. The Committee found that the petitioner's statement was closely linked to the authors of the attack and that the petitioner's choice of remedy was not a controversial issue at the national level. The Committee declared the communication admissible insofar as it relates to the State party's alleged failure fully to investigate the incident. The Committee recalls its earlier jurisprudence that criminal laws and other legal provisions prohibiting racial discrimination must be effectively implemented by the competent national tribunals and other State institutions. The Committee notes the petitioner's claim that the reference in her statement to the fact that her aggressors came out of the Somali clubs constituted an act of racial discrimination. The Committee considers that the statement concerned cannot necessarily be interpreted as expressly claiming that persons of Somali origin were responsible for the attack in question. The Committee cannot conclude that the investigation conducted by the national authorities into the 1998 incident did not meet the requirements of an effective remedy under the Convention. The main issue in the case is whether the State party fulfilled its positive obligation to take effective action against reported incidents of racial discrimination. The Committee emphasizes the importance of effective investigations into allegations of racial discrimination and the role of politicians and members of political parties in promoting the Convention's provisions. The Committee notes that the investigation conducted by the national authorities did not meet the requirements of an effective remedy under the Convention. The Committee highlights the need for States parties to ensure that the police and judicial authorities conduct thorough investigations into allegations of acts of racial discrimination.

Decisions and Rulings:
The document does not provide specific court decisions or rulings. However, it mentions that the petitioner failed to exhaust domestic remedies, and the State party argues that the institution of proceedings under section 267 (1) of the Criminal Code could be considered an effective remedy. The public prosecutor decided not to initiate an investigation, and the petitioner disputes this decision.

Impact and Significance:
The case has implications for the protection of the rights of individuals of Somali origin in Denmark and more broadly, for the implementation of the Convention's provisions related to racial discrimination. It highlights the importance of effective investigations and the role of politicians and members of political parties in promoting the Convention's provisions. The case may serve as a precedent for future cases related to racial discrimination in Denmark and beyond.
