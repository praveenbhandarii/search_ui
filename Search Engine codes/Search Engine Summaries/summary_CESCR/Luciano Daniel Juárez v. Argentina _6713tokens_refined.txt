- Key Parties Involved: Luciano Daniel Jurez (author) vs. Argentina (State party)
- Case Name: Luciano Daniel Jurez v. Argentina
- Case Summary: The author, a judge of first instance in the provincial court system of Rosario, Argentina, alleges that the State party has violated his rights under article 7 (c) of the Covenant by not appointing him to a vacant position in chamber No. III of Rosario Civil and Commercial Court of Appeal, despite his high ranking in a competitive examination.

Procedural History:
The author, Luciano Daniel Jurez, filed a communication to the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights regarding the violation of his rights under article 7 (c) of the Covenant. The communication concerns the appointment of judges and the exhaustion of domestic remedies.

Legal Analysis and Reasoning:
The legal issues addressed in the case include the right to just and favourable conditions of work, the exhaustion of domestic remedies, and the right to an effective remedy. The author claims that the State party violated his rights under article 7 (c) of the Covenant by not appointing him to the vacant position despite his high ranking in the competitive examination.

Decisions and Rulings:
The Committee considered the communication inadmissible under Article 3(1) of the Optional Protocol, as the author failed to exhaust all effective domestic remedies. The Committee found that the author's subjective view that domestic remedies were unlikely to succeed does not constitute an objective argument for contesting their effectiveness.

Impact and Significance:
The decision sets a precedent for the requirement to exhaust all effective domestic remedies before bringing a case to the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. It emphasizes the importance of invoking the rights due under the Covenant and the necessity of exhausting all available legal remedies.
