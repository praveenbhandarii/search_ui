Procedural History:
The United Nations Economic and Social Council's Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (CESCR) received an individual communication (No. 105/2019) from E.H.A. et al. on behalf of themselves and a minor daughter, regarding their eviction for non-payment of mortgage. The Committee requested Spain, the state party, to take interim measures to suspend the eviction or provide adequate alternative housing, in genuine consultation with the authors. The authors failed to respond to repeated requests for comments on the state party's request for discontinuance. The Committee discontinued consideration of the communication at its 73rd session (13 February - 3 March 2023) in accordance with Rule 18 of its Rules of Procedure under the Optional Protocol. The decision was adopted by the Committee on 20 April 2023.

Legal Analysis and Reasoning:
The authors alleged that their eviction for nonpayment of mortgage violated their right to adequate housing under Article 11(1) of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. The Committee requested Spain to take interim measures to suspend the eviction or provide adequate alternative housing, but the authors failed to respond to repeated requests for comments on the State party's request for discontinuance.

Decisions and Rulings:
The Committee discontinued consideration of the communication at its meeting on 27 February 2023, in accordance with rule 18 of its rules of procedure under the Optional Protocol.

Impact and Significance:
The discontinuation of the communication by the Committee has implications for the right to adequate housing and the obligations of state parties under the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. It sets a precedent for the procedural requirements and the role of the Committee in addressing communications related to housing rights.
