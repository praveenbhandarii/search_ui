Procedural History:
The communication No. 76/2018 was submitted by N.M.H. on behalf of herself and her minor children to the United Nations Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. The alleged violation of the right to adequate housing (Article 11(1) of the Covenant) due to eviction from a dwelling occupied without legal title was brought to the attention of the Committee. The Committee requested interim measures to suspend eviction or provide adequate alternative housing. However, the author failed to respond to repeated requests for comments on the State party's observations, leading to the discontinuation of consideration of the communication by the Committee in accordance with rule 17 of its provisional rules of procedure under the Optional Protocol.

Legal Analysis and Reasoning:
The legal issues addressed in this case include the right to adequate housing as provided for in Article 11(1) of the Covenant. The Committee's analysis focused on the failure of the author to respond to requests for comments on the State party's observations, which led to the discontinuation of consideration of the communication.

Decisions and Rulings:
The Committee discontinued its consideration of the communication in accordance with its provisional rules of procedure under the Optional Protocol, due to the author's failure to respond to requests for comments on the State party's observations.

Impact and Significance:
