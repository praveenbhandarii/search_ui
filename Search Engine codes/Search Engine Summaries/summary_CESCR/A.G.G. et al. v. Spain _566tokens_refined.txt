- Case Name: A.G.G. et al. v. Spain
- Case Summary: The authors and their son alleged that their eviction from their home without legal title violated their right to adequate housing under Article 11(1) of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.

Procedural History:
The communication was submitted on 31 October 2018. The Committee requested Spain to take interim measures to suspend the eviction or provide adequate alternative housing, in genuine consultation with the authors. The authors failed to respond to repeated requests for comments on the state party's observations, leading to the discontinuation of the communication at the seventy-third session in 2023.

Legal Analysis and Reasoning:
The substantive issue addressed was the eviction for occupation without legal title, which was found to be in violation of the right to adequate housing under Article 11(1) of the Covenant. The authors' failure to respond to requests for comments on the state party's observations was a procedural issue.

Decisions and Rulings:
The UNCESCR discontinued consideration of the communication due to the authors' failure to respond to repeated requests for comments on the State party's observations.

Impact and Significance:
The case sets a precedent for the importance of responding to requests for comments in communications to the UNCESCR. It also highlights the Committee's commitment to upholding the right to adequate housing under the Covenant.
