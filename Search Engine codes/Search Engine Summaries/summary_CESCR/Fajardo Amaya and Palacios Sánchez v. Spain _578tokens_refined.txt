- Case Summary: The authors submitted a communication to the UNCESCR claiming a violation of their right to adequate housing under Article 11(1) of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, as they were facing eviction from a dwelling rented from someone who was no longer the owner.

Procedural History:
The communication was submitted on November 20, 2018, and the Committee requested the State party (Spain) to take interim measures to suspend the eviction or provide adequate alternative housing.

The Committee discontinued consideration of the communication at its seventy-third session in February 2023.

Legal Analysis and Reasoning:
The legal issue addressed was the right to adequate housing under Article 11(1) of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. The Committee examined the request for interim measures to suspend the eviction or provide adequate alternative housing, in genuine consultation with the authors.

Decisions and Rulings:
The decision of the UNCESCR was adopted on 27 February 2023, and it discontinued consideration of the communication due to the authors' request for discontinuance on the grounds that they had found alternative housing.

Impact and Significance:
The discontinuation of the communication signifies that the authors' request for alternative housing was granted, and the case was resolved without further proceedings. This sets a precedent for the protection of the right to adequate housing under the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.
