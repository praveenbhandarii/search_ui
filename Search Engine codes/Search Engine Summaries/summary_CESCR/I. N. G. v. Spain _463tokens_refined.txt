- Case Name: I.N.G. v. Spain
- Case Summary: The author and her minor daughter were evicted from social rental housing that was subsequently sold to a private fund. The Committee considered communication No. 49/2018, which alleged a violation of the right to adequate housing due to eviction from social rental housing. The Committee requested interim measures to suspend the eviction or provide alternative housing but ultimately discontinued consideration of the communication due to the author's failure to respond to requests for comments.

Procedural History:
The communication was submitted by I.N.G. on behalf of herself and her minor daughter on 17 September 2018. The Committee requested the State party to take interim measures to suspend the eviction of the author and her daughter pending the consideration of the communication or to provide them with adequate alternative housing. The Committee discontinued its consideration of the communication at its seventieth session (27 September-15 October 2021) due to the author's failure to respond to repeated requests for comments on the State party's observations.

Legal Analysis and Reasoning:
The legal issue addressed in this case was the alleged violation of the right to adequate housing under Article 11(1) of the Covenant, due to the eviction from social rental housing that was subsequently sold to a private fund. The Committee's analysis focused on the request for interim measures to suspend the eviction or provide adequate alternative housing, as well as the author's failure to respond to requests for comments on the State party's observations.

Decisions and Rulings:
The Committee requested interim measures to suspend the eviction of the author and her daughter pending the consideration of the communication or to provide them with adequate alternative housing. However, the Committee ultimately discontinued its consideration of the communication due to the author's failure to respond to repeated requests for comments on the State party's observations.

Impact and Significance:
The discontinuation of the consideration of the communication by the Committee may have implications for future cases involving similar issues of eviction from social rental housing and the right to adequate housing under the Covenant. The case sets a precedent for the importance of timely and thorough communication with the Committee in such matters.
