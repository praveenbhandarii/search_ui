- Case Summary: The authors, who are occupying a dwelling belonging to the Social Housing Agency without legal title, were ordered to be evicted. They claim that their eviction would violate their rights under article 11 of the Covenant, as they do not have alternative accommodation.

Procedural History:
The authors, Fatima El Mourabit Ouazizi and Mohamed Boudfan, submitted the communication on 2 May 2019. The Committee adopted the Views on 10 October 2022, after considering the admissibility and merits of the case.

Legal Analysis and Reasoning:
The legal issues addressed in the case include the right to adequate housing under Article 11 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. The authors claim that their eviction would violate this right, while the State party argues that the authors have not exhausted domestic remedies and that their occupation of the dwelling is unlawful.

Decisions and Rulings:
The Committee declared the communication admissible and proceeded to consider it on the merits. It found that the State party had not violated the authors' right to housing and that the authors had not demonstrated a degree of diligence in their search for housing.

Impact and Significance:
The decision sets a precedent for cases involving the right to adequate housing under the Covenant. It emphasizes the importance of demonstrating diligence in seeking alternative housing options and the obligation of individuals to take on certain reasonable burdens or duties for the success of housing policies.
