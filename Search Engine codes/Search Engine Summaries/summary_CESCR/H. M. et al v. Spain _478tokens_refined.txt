- Case Summary: The authors and their son, who were facing eviction from their home without legal title, submitted a communication to the UNCESCR claiming a violation of their right to adequate housing under Article 11(1) of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.

Procedural History:
The authors, H.M. and F.J.H.H., submitted a communication to the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights on behalf of themselves and their 11-year-old son. The communication was regarding their eviction from a house they were occupying without legal title. The Committee requested the State party to take interim measures to suspend the eviction or provide adequate alternative housing, in genuine consultation with the authors. The authors later requested to withdraw the case as they had been granted social assistance for the housing they occupied after it was acquired from the Community of Madrid by the Municipality of Arganda del Rey. The Committee discontinued its consideration of the communication under rule 17 of its provisional rules of procedure under the Optional Protocol.

Legal Analysis and Reasoning:
The authors alleged that their eviction would violate their right to adequate housing under Article 11(1) of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. The Committee requested interim measures from the State party and later discontinued consideration of the communication after the authors withdrew their request.

Decisions and Rulings:
The Committee requested Spain to take interim measures to suspend the eviction of the authors and their son pending the consideration of the communication or to provide them with adequate alternative housing, in genuine consultation with them. The Committee discontinued its consideration of communication No. 162/2019 after the authors requested to withdraw the case, citing that they had been granted social assistance for the housing they occupied after it was acquired from the Community of Madrid by the Municipality of Arganda del Rey.

Impact and Significance:
The case highlights the importance of the right to adequate housing under the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the role of the UNCESCR in addressing violations of this right. It also demonstrates the potential impact of social assistance in resolving housing issues for individuals facing eviction.
