Case Details:
- Case ID: E/C.12/71/D/69/2018
- Court/Tribunal: United Nations Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (UNCESCR)
- Document Date: 2022
- Key Parties Involved: A.S.M.C. (author and alleged victim) vs. Spain (state party)
- Case Name: A.S.M.C. v. Spain
- Case Summary: The author and her two minor children were facing eviction from a dwelling they occupied without title and owned by a private fund. The author submitted a communication to the UNCESCR claiming violation of their right to adequate housing under Article 11(1) of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.

Procedural History:
The United Nations Economic and Social Council's Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights received a communication (No. 69/2018) from A.S.M.C. on behalf of herself and her two minor children, alleging violation of their right to adequate housing by Spain. The communication was registered on October 26, 2018, and the Committee requested Spain to take interim measures to suspend the eviction of the author and her children or provide them with adequate alternative housing, while also requesting the author to provide comments on the State party's request for discontinuance.

Legal Analysis and Reasoning:
The legal details of the case include the specific article of the Covenant (Article 11(1)) that was alleged to have been violated, the procedural issue of requesting interim measures to suspend eviction and provide adequate alternative housing, the substantive issue of the right to adequate housing, and the subject matter of eviction from a dwelling occupied without title and owned by a private fund.

Decisions and Rulings:
The UNCESCR requested Spain to take interim measures to suspend the eviction of the author and her children pending the consideration of the communication or to provide them with adequate alternative housing, in genuine consultation with them. However, the author failed to respond to repeated requests for comments on the state party's request for discontinuance, and the UNCESCR consequently discontinued consideration of the communication at its seventy-first session (February 14-March 4, 2022).

Impact and Significance:
The decision to discontinue consideration of the communication due to the author's lack of response to requests for comments sets a precedent for the importance of active participation in the legal process. It also highlights the significance of genuine consultation with affected parties in cases involving the right to adequate housing.
