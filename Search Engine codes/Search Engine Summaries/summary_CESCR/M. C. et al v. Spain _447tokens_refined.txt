Procedural History:
- The United Nations Economic and Social Council's Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights received communication No. 55/2018 from M.C. on September 17, 2018, regarding their eviction without legal title and right to adequate housing.
- The Committee requested Spain, the state party, to take interim measures to suspend the eviction or provide adequate alternative housing, in genuine consultation with the author and her family.
- The author failed to respond to the Committee's repeated requests for comments, resulting in the Committee discontinuing its consideration of the communication under rule 17 of its provisional rules of procedure under the Optional Protocol.

Legal Analysis and Reasoning:
- Article of the Covenant: 11 (1)
- Procedural issue: Failure to respond to repeated requests for comments
- Substantive issue: Eviction for occupation without legal title; right to adequate housing
- Subject matter: Housing

Decisions and Rulings:
- The Committee requested Spain to take interim measures to suspend the eviction of the author, her daughter, and her nephews pending the consideration of the communication or to provide them with adequate alternative housing, in genuine consultation with them.
- The Committee later decided to discontinue its consideration of the communication due to the author's failure to respond to its repeated requests for comments.

Impact and Significance:
- The discontinuation of the communication under rule 17 of the provisional rules of procedure under the Optional Protocol sets a precedent for the importance of active participation and response from the author in communications to the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.
