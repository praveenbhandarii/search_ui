- Key Parties Involved: S.S. et al. (authors and their son) vs. Spain (State party)
- Case Name: S.S. et al. v. Spain
- Case Summary: The authors and their son submitted a communication to the UNCESCR alleging that they were facing eviction without legal title and that the State party had failed to provide them with adequate alternative housing, in violation of Article 11(1) of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.

Procedural History:
The United Nations Economic and Social Council's Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights received an individual communication (No. 65/2018) from S.S. et al. on behalf of themselves and their minor son. The communication was registered on October 22, 2018, and the Committee requested Spain to take interim measures to suspend the eviction of the authors and their son or provide them with adequate alternative housing, while genuinely consulting with them. The authors failed to respond to repeated requests for comments on Spain's observations, leading the Committee to conclude that they had lost interest and discontinue consideration of the communication at its 72nd session (September 26 - October 14, 2022).

Legal Analysis and Reasoning:
The substantive issue addressed in the communication was the eviction for occupation without legal title and the right to adequate housing, in violation of Article 11(1) of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. The authors alleged that Spain had failed to provide them with adequate alternative housing.

Decisions and Rulings:
The decision of the UNCESCR was adopted on 10 October 2022, and it discontinued consideration of the communication due to the authors' failure to respond to repeated requests for comments on the State party's observations, in accordance with rule 18 of the Committee's rules of procedure under the Optional Protocol.

Impact and Significance:
The discontinuation of the communication by the UNCESCR due to the authors' failure to respond to requests for comments sets a precedent for the importance of active participation in the communication process. It also highlights the significance of genuine consultation and cooperation between the parties involved in such cases.
