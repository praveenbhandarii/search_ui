- Document Dates: 2021
- Key Parties Involved:
  - Party A: Gladis Patricia Loor Chila (represented by Carmen Oriol Fita)
  - Party B: Spain
- Case Name: Gladis Patricia Loor Chila v. Spain
- Case Summary: The author, Gladis Patricia Loor Chila, a national of Spain and Ecuador, filed a complaint against Spain for violating her rights and those of her minor grandchildren under article 11 (1) of the Covenant, following an eviction notice issued by the fund that owned the dwelling. The UNCESCR requested Spain to suspend the eviction or provide alternative housing to avoid causing irreparable damage.

Procedural History:
- The author, a single mother, and her three grandchildren were facing eviction from their home due to non-payment of rent.
- The author had been occupying the property without legal title since February 2018.
- The author submitted an individual communication to the Committee on 1 February 2019, requesting interim measures to prevent the eviction.
- The State party raised several objections to the admissibility of the communication and argued that the author's rights and those of her grandchildren were not violated.

Legal Analysis and Reasoning:
- Legal Issues Addressed: Right to adequate housing, access to public housing, violation of Covenant rights
- Relevant Legal Provisions: Article 11(1) of the Covenant
- Court's Analysis: The State party argued that the author's occupation of a dwelling without applying for public housing falls outside the scope of protection of Article 11(1) of the Covenant.

Decisions and Rulings:
- The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (the Committee) considered the communication inadmissible due to lack of substantiation.
- The Committee found that the author had not satisfactorily substantiated a situation of need arising from a lack of sufficient income to access the private housing market.
- The Committee concluded that the communication was insufficiently substantiated for the purposes of admissibility and was inadmissible pursuant to article 3(2)(e) of the Optional Protocol.

Impact and Significance:
- The case sets a precedent for the level of substantiation required for a communication to be admissible under the Optional Protocol.
- It highlights the importance of providing sufficient evidence to support claims of violations of Covenant rights.
