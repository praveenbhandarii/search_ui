Case Details:

- Court/Tribunal: United Nations Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (UNCESCR)
- Document Date: 2020
- Key Parties Involved: M.B.B. (represented by Beatriz Prez Garca) vs. Spain
- Case Name: M.B.B. v. Spain
- Case Summary: M.B.B., a Spanish national, submitted a communication to the UNCESCR claiming that her rights and those of her children under article 11 (1) of the Covenant had been violated due to their imminent eviction from their home without alternative adequate housing.

Procedural History:
The author, M.B.B., a Spanish national, and her children, J.I.M.B. and M.M.B., faced eviction from their home. The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights registered the communication and requested the State party to suspend the eviction or provide adequate housing. The eviction ultimately took place on November 15, 2019.

Legal Analysis and Reasoning:
The main legal issues addressed in the case were whether the eviction of the author and her children from their home constitutes a violation of their right to adequate housing under article 11(1) of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, and whether the State party has fulfilled its obligation to ensure that the author and her children have access to adequate housing.

Decisions and Rulings:
The Committee found that the claim of a violation of the right to adequate housing and the children's right to education was insufficiently substantiated for purposes of admissibility and therefore inadmissible under the Optional Protocol.

Impact and Significance:
The decision sets a precedent for the admissibility of claims related to the right to adequate housing and the right to education under the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.
