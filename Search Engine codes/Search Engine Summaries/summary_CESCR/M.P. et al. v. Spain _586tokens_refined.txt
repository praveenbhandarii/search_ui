- Case Summary: The authors, on behalf of themselves and their three minor children, submitted a communication to the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, alleging violation of their right to adequate housing due to eviction from their dwelling following termination of the lease. The Committee requested Spain to take interim measures to suspend the eviction or provide adequate alternative housing, but the authors failed to respond to repeated requests for comments on Spain's observations, leading the Committee to discontinue consideration of the communication.

Procedural History:
The United Nations Economic and Social Council's Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights received an individual communication from M.P. et al. on October 10, 2018, on behalf of themselves and their three minor children, regarding their eviction from a dwelling following the termination of the lease. The Committee requested Spain, the state party, to take interim measures to suspend the eviction or provide adequate alternative housing, in genuine consultation with the authors. The authors failed to respond to repeated requests for comments on the state party's observations, leading the Committee to conclude that they had lost interest and discontinue consideration of the communication.

Legal Analysis and Reasoning:
The legal issues addressed in this case pertain to the right to adequate housing under Article 11(1) of the Covenant. The authors, M.P. et al., submitted the communication, alleging a violation of this right due to their eviction from their dwelling. The Committee's analysis focused on the failure of the authors to respond to requests for comments on Spain's observations, which led to the discontinuation of the communication.

Decisions and Rulings:
The Committee adopted the decision to discontinue consideration of the communication at its 72nd session (September 26 - October 14, 2022). The decision was made by the members of the Committee, with one member recusing himself in accordance with the rules of procedure under the Optional Protocol to the Covenant.

Impact and Significance:
The discontinuation of the communication has implications for the authors, as it signifies the end of the Committee's consideration of their allegations regarding the violation of their right to adequate housing. The case sets a precedent for the importance of responding to requests for comments in the communication process with the Committee.
