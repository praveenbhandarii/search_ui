- Key Parties Involved:
  - Party A: Leonardo Fabio Muoz Garca (represented by counsel, Juan Carlos Rois Alonso)
  - Party B: Spain
- Case Name: Muoz Garca v. Spain

Procedural History:
The author, a Spanish national, claimed that the State party had violated his rights under article 11 (1) of the Covenant by ordering his eviction from a dwelling that he owned subject to a mortgage. The Committee considered the admissibility of the communication and found that the author had not exhausted domestic remedies and had not sufficiently substantiated his claims.

Legal Analysis and Reasoning:
The case concerns the eviction of a family from their home due to non-payment of mortgage installments. The family's monthly income is limited to the father's salary of approximately 1,100, as the mother and son are unemployed. The family does not have access to adequate alternative housing due to their limited income. The State party has taken various measures to alleviate the impact of financial crises on the most vulnerable mortgagors.

Decisions and Rulings:
The Committee found that the author had not shown that he was diligent in seeking assistance from the administrative authorities to secure access to alternative housing. The Committee held that the author's failure to act with due diligence and his failure to substantiate his claims rendered his communication inadmissible under articles 3(1) and 3(2)(e) of the Optional Protocol.

Impact and Significance:
The decision sets a precedent for cases involving the right to adequate housing and the obligation of individuals to exhaust domestic remedies before seeking international intervention. It also highlights the importance of due diligence in seeking assistance from administrative authorities in housing-related cases.
