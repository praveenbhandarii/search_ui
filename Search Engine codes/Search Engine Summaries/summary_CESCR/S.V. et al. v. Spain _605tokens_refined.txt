Procedural History:
The communication was submitted by S.V. et al. on 9 February 2019, requesting interim measures to suspend the eviction or provide adequate alternative housing.

The Committee discontinued consideration of the communication due to the authors' failure to respond to repeated requests for comments on the State party's request for discontinuance.

Impact and Significance:
The discontinuation of the communication highlights the importance of active participation and cooperation from all parties involved in the legal process. It also emphasizes the significance of genuine consultation with the authors in cases involving the right to adequate housing.
