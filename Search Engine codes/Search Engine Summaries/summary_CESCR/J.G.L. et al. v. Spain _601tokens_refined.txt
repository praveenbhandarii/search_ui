- Key Parties Involved:
  - Alleged victims: J.G.L. et al.
  - State party: Spain
- Case Name: J.G.L. et al. v. Spain
- Case Summary: The authors, who stopped paying rent due to lack of resources, were facing eviction from their dwelling. They submitted a communication to the Committee claiming a violation of their right to adequate housing. The Committee requested Spain to take interim measures to suspend the eviction or provide adequate alternative housing. However, the authors failed to respond to repeated requests for comments on the State party's observations on the admissibility and merits of the communication, and the Committee discontinued consideration of the communication.

Procedural History:
The United Nations Economic and Social Council's Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (CESCR) received an individual communication (No. 77/2018) from alleged victims (J.G.L. et al.) against Spain regarding their eviction from a dwelling due to non-payment of rent. The Committee requested Spain to take interim measures to suspend the eviction or provide adequate alternative housing, in consultation with the authors. The authors failed to respond to repeated requests for comments on Spain's observations on the admissibility and merits of the communication. The Committee concluded that the authors had lost interest and discontinued consideration of the communication at its 71st session (14 February - 4 March 2022).

Legal Analysis and Reasoning:
The legal issues addressed in this case include the right to adequate housing as per Article 11(1) of the Covenant. The authors' failure to respond to requests for comments on Spain's observations on the admissibility and merits of the communication was a procedural issue. The substantive issue was the eviction from a dwelling due to non-payment of rent.

Decisions and Rulings:
The Committee adopted a decision on 28 February 2022, discontinuing consideration of the communication due to the authors' failure to respond to requests for comments. The Committee found that the authors had lost interest in pursuing the communication.

Impact and Significance:
This case sets a precedent for the importance of active participation and cooperation in the communication process with the Committee. It highlights the significance of responding to requests for comments and maintaining engagement in the proceedings.
