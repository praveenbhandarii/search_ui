- Case Name: Deisy Karina Gmez Torres and her minor daughter v. Spain
- Case Summary: The author and her minor daughter were evicted from a dwelling they had rented from someone who turned out not to be the owner. The author submitted a communication to the UNCESCR claiming a violation of their right to adequate housing under Article 11(1) of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. The Committee requested Spain to take interim measures to suspend the eviction or provide adequate alternative housing. The author later withdrew the case after being granted alternative housing, and the Committee discontinued consideration of the communication.

Procedural History:
The United Nations Economic and Social Council's Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights received a communication (No. 67/2018) from Deisy Karina Gmez Torres, alleging violation of her right to adequate housing in Spain. The Committee requested Spain to take interim measures to suspend the eviction of Gmez Torres and her daughter or provide them with adequate alternative housing, pending the consideration of the communication. Spain requested the discontinuance of the consideration of the communication, and Gmez Torres withdrew the case as alternative housing had been granted. The Committee discontinued consideration of the communication at its 71st session (14 February-4 March 2022) in accordance with Rule 18 of its Rules of Procedure under the Optional Protocol.

Legal Analysis and Reasoning:
The legal issue addressed in this case was the right to adequate housing under Article 11(1) of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. The Committee considered the procedural issue of the request for interim measures and discontinuance of the communication, as well as the substantive issue of the right to adequate housing in the context of eviction from a dwelling and the provision of alternative housing.

Decisions and Rulings:
The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights considered communication No. 67/2018 and requested Spain to take interim measures to protect the right to adequate housing of Deisy Karina Gmez Torres and her minor daughter. However, the Committee ultimately discontinued consideration of the communication after Spain requested discontinuance and Gmez Torres withdrew the case following the provision of alternative housing.

Impact and Significance:
This case sets a precedent for the Committee's consideration of communications regarding the right to adequate housing under the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. It highlights the importance of interim measures to protect individuals from eviction and the significance of providing alternative housing in cases of housing rights violations.
