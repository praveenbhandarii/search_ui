- Case Summary: The authors, on behalf of themselves and their minor daughters, submitted an individual communication to the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, alleging violation of their right to adequate housing due to eviction without legal title.

Procedural History:
The United Nations Economic and Social Council's Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights received an individual communication from M.G. and R.V. on behalf of themselves and their minor daughters regarding their eviction without legal title. The Committee requested Spain, the state party, to take interim measures to suspend the eviction or provide adequate alternative housing, while considering the communication. The authors did not respond to the Committee's repeated requests for comments, leading the Committee to assume they had lost interest in the communication. The Committee discontinued its consideration of communication No. 44/2018 pursuant to rule 17 of its provisional rules of procedure under the Optional Protocol.

Legal Analysis and Reasoning:
The substantive issue addressed in this case is the eviction for occupation without legal title, which is a violation of the right to adequate housing under Article 11(1) of the Covenant. The authors, M.G. and R.V., submitted the communication to the Committee, but their failure to respond to requests for comments led to the discontinuation of the case.

Decisions and Rulings:
The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights discontinued its consideration of communication No. 44/2018 due to the authors' lack of response, as per rule 17 of its provisional rules of procedure under the Optional Protocol.

Impact and Significance:
This case highlights the importance of active participation and cooperation from the parties involved in a communication to the Committee. It also emphasizes the Committee's authority to discontinue consideration if the parties fail to engage in the process.
