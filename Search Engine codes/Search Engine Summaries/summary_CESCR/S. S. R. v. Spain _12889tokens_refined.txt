Case Details:

- Document Dates: 2019
- Key Parties Involved:
  - Party A: S.S.R. (the author and victim)
  - Party B: Spain (the state party)
- Case Name: S.S.R. v. Spain

Procedural History:
The author, S.S.R., a Spanish national, alleged a violation of her rights under Article 11(1) of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. The communication was registered on September 5, 2018, and the State party was requested to suspend the eviction of the author or provide her with adequate housing. The Committee considered the admissibility and merits of the communication and adopted its decision on October 11, 2019.

Legal Analysis and Reasoning:
The author claimed that the State party violated her right to adequate housing by carrying out the eviction without providing alternative housing. She referenced the Committee's jurisprudence and the European Court of Human Rights' jurisprudence on evictions and the right to adequate housing. The State party argued that the author did not reply to messages informing her of the benefits to which she might be entitled and that she failed to keep appointments with social service providers.

Decisions and Rulings:
The Committee found the communication admissible, as it referred to a possible violation of a right set forth in the Covenant. The Committee requested interim measures to prevent the eviction, but the State party failed to comply. The Committee declared the communication inadmissible under article 3(2)(e) of the Optional Protocol.

Impact and Significance:
The case sets a precedent for the Committee's role in protecting Covenant rights through interim measures. It highlights the importance of providing alternative housing in eviction cases and the obligations of State parties under the Covenant.
