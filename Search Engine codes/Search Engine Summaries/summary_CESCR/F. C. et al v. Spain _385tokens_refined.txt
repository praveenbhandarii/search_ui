Procedural History:
The United Nations Economic and Social Council's Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights received an individual communication (No. 66/2018) from alleged victims F.C. et al. against Spain on October 22, 2018. The Committee registered the communication and requested Spain to take interim measures to suspend the eviction or provide adequate alternative housing, in consultation with the authors. At its meeting on February 22, 2021, the Committee noted the authors' request to set aside their communication as their housing situation had stabilized, and accordingly discontinued its consideration of communication No. 66/2018, in line with rule 17 of its provisional rules of procedure under the Optional Protocol. The decision was adopted by the Committee at its sixty-ninth session (February 15-March 5, 2021).
