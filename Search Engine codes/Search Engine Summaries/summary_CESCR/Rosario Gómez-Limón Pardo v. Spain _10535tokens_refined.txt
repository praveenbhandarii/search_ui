- Case Name: Rosario GmezLimn Pardo v. Spain

Procedural History:
The author, a Spanish citizen, alleged that her rights under article 11 (1) of the Covenant were violated by the State party when she was evicted from her home without adequate housing being provided. The case was initially submitted on 30 August 2018, and the Views were adopted by the Committee on 5 March 2020.

Legal Analysis and Reasoning:
The key legal issues addressed in the case included the violation of the right to adequate housing under article 11 (1) of the Covenant, failure to protect the author from gender-based violence, and the lawfulness and reasonableness of the rejection of the author's application for social housing. The Committee found that the State party violated the author's right to housing under article 11 of the Covenant by failing to assess the proportionality of the eviction before making the decision to evict.

Decisions and Rulings:
The Committee found that the author's eviction may have violated her right to adequate housing under Article 11(1) of the Covenant. It noted that forced evictions are prima facie incompatible with the Covenant and can only be justified in exceptional circumstances. The State party was found to have violated the author's right to housing under article 11 of the Covenant, read in conjunction with article 2(1).

Impact and Significance:
The case sets a precedent for the assessment of the proportionality of evictions before making decisions, emphasizing the importance of protecting individuals' rights to adequate housing under international law.
