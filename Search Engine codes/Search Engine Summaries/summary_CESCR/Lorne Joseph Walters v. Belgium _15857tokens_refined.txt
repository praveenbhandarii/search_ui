Case Details:
- Case ID: E/C.12/70/D/61/2018
- Court/Tribunal: United Nations Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (UNCESCR)
- Document Dates: 2021
- Key Parties Involved:
  - Lorne Joseph Walters (the author and victim, represented by counsel, Christine Rygaert)
  - Belgium (the state party)
- Case Name: Lorne Joseph Walters v. Belgium

Procedural History:
The author, Lorne Joseph Walters, a Belgian citizen, alleges that his rights under article 11 of the International Covenant on Economic, Cultural and Social Rights were violated by the State party when the owner of his rented apartment terminated his lease and the court ratified the rental notice and ordered his eviction. The author submitted the communication on 5 October 2018, and the Views were adopted by the Committee in 2021.

Legal Analysis and Reasoning:
The case involves the termination of a lease agreement without cause, leading to the eviction of the author, who is an older person with limited income. The author claims that the State party's legislation on leases is contrary to the Covenant and has a disproportionate impact on older persons. The Committee considered the specific circumstances of the case, the legislative framework, and the State party's response to the author's requests for housing.

Decisions and Rulings:
The Committee found that the rigid application of the legislative framework on leases and the eviction procedure constituted a violation by the State party of the author's right to adequate housing. The State party's failure to provide adequate alternative accommodation to the author, despite his vulnerable situation, contributed to the violation of his right to adequate housing.

Impact and Significance:
The Committee's decision sets a precedent for cases involving the rights of tenants, particularly older persons, and the obligation of States parties to ensure security of tenure and provide adequate alternative accommodation. The decision emphasizes the importance of guaranteeing non-repetition and ensuring that legislation and enforcement are consistent with the obligations established under the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.

Citations and References:
The decision is based on the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the Vienna International Plan of Action on Ageing, and relevant jurisprudence on the right to adequate housing and forced evictions.
