Case Details:

- Court/Tribunal: United Nations Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (UNCESCR)
- Document Date: 2021
- Key Parties Involved: K.A.N. (author and alleged victim) and Spain (state party)
- Case Name: K.A.N. v. Spain
- Case Summary: The author and her two minor children were facing eviction from a dwelling they occupied without legal title. The author submitted an individual communication to the Committee on her behalf and on behalf of her children, alleging violation of their right to adequate housing.

Procedural History:
The communication was submitted by K.A.N. on behalf of herself and her two minor children on 29 October 2018. The Committee requested Spain to take interim measures to suspend the eviction of the author and her children pending the consideration of the communication or to provide them with adequate alternative housing. The author failed to respond to repeated requests for comments on the state party's observations, leading to the discontinuation of the consideration by the Committee.

Legal Analysis and Reasoning:
The legal issue addressed in this case was the right to adequate housing under Article 11(1) of the Covenant. The Committee's analysis focused on the request for interim measures to suspend eviction or provide adequate alternative housing. The author's lack of response to the state party's observations was a key factor in the Committee's decision to discontinue consideration.

Decisions and Rulings:
The Committee decided to discontinue its consideration of the communication in accordance with rule 17 of its provisional rules of procedure under the Optional Protocol due to the author's lack of response.

Impact and Significance:
This case sets a precedent for the importance of active participation and response from the author in communications submitted to the Committee. It also highlights the Committee's commitment to ensuring genuine consultation with individuals involved in cases related to economic, social, and cultural rights.
