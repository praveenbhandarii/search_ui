- Case Name: A.M.O. and J.M.U. v. Spain
- Case Summary: The authors, A.M.O. and J.M.U., are alleging a violation of their rights under article 11 (1) of the Covenant due to their eviction from a property they had been occupying since 2015 without alternative housing being provided. They are requesting the Committee to take interim measures to suspend the eviction or provide adequate alternative housing.

Procedural History:
The authors, A.M.O. and J.M.U., are a Romanian citizen and a Spanish citizen, respectively, who are acting on behalf of themselves and their three minor children. They are alleging a violation of their rights under Article 11(1) of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights due to their eviction from a property they have been occupying since 2015 without alternative housing being provided. The property belongs to a bank, which has been attempting to evict the family since 2017. The authors have been requesting alternative housing from the autonomous regional government of Valencia but have not received a favorable response. The Court has ordered the eviction to take place on multiple occasions, but it has been postponed or suspended due to the authors' appeals.

Legal Analysis and Reasoning:
The case involves the alleged violation of the right to adequate housing under Article 11(1) of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. The authors claim that their eviction without alternative housing being provided constitutes a violation of this right. The State party has argued that the communication should be declared inadmissible as the authors continue to live in the property and their needs are being met by public funds to the extent of available resources.

Decisions and Rulings:
The Committee, through its working group on communications, agreed to lift the interim measures in light of changes in the authors' financial situation. The State party has requested the lifting of interim measures and the discontinuance of the communication, citing that the situation has ceased to exist since the authors have not been evicted and alternative housing is being sought for them.

Impact and Significance:
This case highlights the challenges faced by individuals and families in accessing adequate housing and the obligations of the State party to provide alternative housing in cases of eviction. The decision of the Committee to lift the interim measures has implications for the authors' situation and the broader issue of housing rights.
