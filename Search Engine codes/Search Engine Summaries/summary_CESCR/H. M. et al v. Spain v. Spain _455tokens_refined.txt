Procedural History:
The authors, H.M. and R.M., and their children, submitted a communication to the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights on 7 November 2017. The communication alleged violations of their rights under the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, specifically the right to adequate housing, due to their eviction from their home without legal title. The Committee requested the State party, Spain, to take interim measures to suspend the eviction or provide adequate alternative housing, and registered the communication on the same date. The authors did not respond to the Committee's repeated requests for comments, and the Committee decided to discontinue its consideration of the communication under rule 17 of its provisional rules of procedure. The decision was adopted by the Committee at its sixtyninth session in February-March 2021.

Legal Analysis and Reasoning:
The legal issue addressed in this case was the alleged violation of the right to adequate housing under Article 11(1) of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. The authors claimed that their eviction from their home without legal title constituted a breach of this right. However, the authors' failure to respond to the Committee's requests for comments led to the discontinuation of the communication.

Decisions and Rulings:
The Committee decided to discontinue its consideration of the communication due to the authors' failure to respond to requests for comments. This decision was made in accordance with rule 17 of the Committee's provisional rules of procedure.

Impact and Significance:
The discontinuation of the communication highlights the importance of active participation and cooperation with international human rights bodies in the pursuit of remedies for alleged rights violations. It also underscores the procedural requirements for maintaining a communication before the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.
