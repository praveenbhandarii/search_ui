- Case Name: Josefa Hernandez Corts and Ricardo Rodriguez Bermudez v. Spain
- Case Summary: The authors, Spanish nationals, submitted a communication to the UNCESCR alleging that their eviction from a dwelling occupied without legal title would violate their rights under article 11 of the Covenant. They claim to have been unable to obtain alternative housing and that their eviction would leave them homeless.

Procedural History:
- The authors have been living in the apartment since 2014 and have faced eviction orders on multiple occasions.
- The State party, Spain, has requested the suspension of the Committee's consideration of the communication, but the Committee has decided not to suspend its consideration.

Legal Analysis and Reasoning:
- The authors claim that their eviction would violate their rights under Article 11 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.
- The State party argues that the right to housing is not an absolute right to a particular dwelling owned by another person and that the authors have not exhausted all domestic remedies.

Decisions and Rulings:
- The Committee finds that the authors have exhausted all available domestic remedies and declares the communication admissible under article 3(1) of the Optional Protocol to ICESCR.

Impact and Significance:
- The Committee emphasizes the State party's obligation to ensure the right to adequate housing, including the provision of alternative housing for those left homeless due to eviction.
- The Committee requests the State party to provide adequate alternative housing that meets all the requirements of an adequate alternative dwelling.
