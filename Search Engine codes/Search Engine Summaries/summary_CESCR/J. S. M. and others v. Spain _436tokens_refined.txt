Procedural History:
The United Nations Economic and Social Council's Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights received a communication (No. 97/2019) from J.S.M. et al. alleging violation of the right to adequate housing in Spain. The communication was registered on July 10, 2018, and the State party was requested to take interim measures to suspend the eviction of the authors or provide them with alternative housing. The Committee considered the communication at its meeting on October 13, 2020. The State party requested discontinuance of the consideration of the communication, and the authors withdrew the case as alternative housing was granted to one of them, and the remaining authors signed a lease on the private market. The Committee discontinued consideration of the communication in accordance with rule 17 of its provisional rules of procedure under the Optional Protocol.

Legal Analysis and Reasoning:
The authors alleged a violation of the right to adequate housing under Article 11(1) of the Covenant. The Committee requested the State party to take interim measures to suspend the eviction of the authors pending the consideration of the communication or to provide them with adequate alternative housing, in genuine consultation with them.

Decisions and Rulings:
The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights considered communication No. 97/2019 regarding eviction for failure to vacate after expiration of lease in Spain. The State party was requested to take interim measures, but the authors later withdrew the case after being granted alternative housing. The Committee discontinued consideration of the communication in accordance with its rules.

Impact and Significance:
The case highlights the importance of the right to adequate housing and the role of international bodies in addressing such issues. It also demonstrates the potential for alternative housing to resolve disputes related to evictions.
