- Case Name: Mohammed Stitou and Mariem Ben Hmdou v. Spain
- Case Summary: The authors, who are nationals of Morocco, submitted a communication to the UNCESCR claiming that their rights under article 11 (1) of the Covenant had been violated by Spain due to their eviction from a dwelling they had been occupying without authorization. The authors claimed that they had no alternative housing and that the eviction would result in irreparable harm to them.

Procedural History:
The authors had been occupying a dwelling in Badalona since February 2015 under an oral lease with a person pretending to be the property's owner. The Court of First Instance No. 5 of Badalona ordered the authors' eviction, which was set for 8 July 2015. The authors requested free legal aid, and the request was granted. The eviction was postponed multiple times, and the authors made requests for affordable housing.

Legal Analysis and Reasoning:
The main issues addressed in the case include the scope of the right to adequate housing under Article 11(1) of the Covenant, the State party's obligations to ensure adequate alternative housing, and whether the authors have demonstrated a violation of the Covenant and exhausted domestic remedies.

Decisions and Rulings:
The Committee found the communication admissible but ultimately concluded that it did not substantiate a violation of the Covenant. The State party's compliance with its international obligations with respect to the right to housing, which is to be realized progressively, was emphasized.

Impact and Significance:
The case sets a precedent for the interpretation of the right to adequate housing under the Covenant and the obligations of State parties in ensuring access to affordable housing. It also highlights the importance of exhausting domestic remedies and providing sufficient documentation in communications to the Committee.
