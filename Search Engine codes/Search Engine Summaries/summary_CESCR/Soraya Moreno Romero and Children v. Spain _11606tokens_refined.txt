- Court/Tribunal: United Nations Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (UNCESCR)
- Document Dates: 2021
- Key Parties Involved:
  - Soraya Moreno Romero (author and applicant)
  - Spain (State party)
- Case Name: Soraya Moreno Romero v. Spain
- Case Summary: The author, a Spanish national, was evicted from her home and claimed that the State party had violated her rights and those of her three minor children under article 11 (1) of the Covenant. The Committee considered the admissibility and merits of the communication and found that the State party had violated the author's rights.

Procedural History:
The author, Soraya Moreno Romero, a Spanish national, acting on her own behalf and on behalf of her three minor children, claimed that the State party violated her rights under article 11 (1) of the Covenant. The Optional Protocol entered into force for the State party on 5 May 2013. The author lived with her minor children in the home of some relatives until May 2015, and then began squatting in a property belonging to a financial institution. The author applied for social housing, but her application was rejected, and she was eventually evicted from the property.

Legal Analysis and Reasoning:
The legal issues addressed in this case include whether the author's eviction without adequate alternative housing violates Article 11(1) of the Covenant, whether the Covenant applies to evictions of persons occupying property without legal right, and whether the Covenant recognizes an enforceable, subjective right to adequate housing or a right that is to be realized progressively. The Committee considered the State party's arguments regarding the author's failure to exhaust all domestic remedies and the availability of alternative housing options.

Decisions and Rulings:
The Committee found that the State party had violated the author's rights under the Covenant by failing to provide adequate alternative housing and by not fulfilling its obligations to protect the author's right to housing. The Committee concluded that the eviction constituted a violation of the author's right to adequate housing under article 11 (1) of the Covenant.

Impact and Significance:
This case sets a precedent for the obligation of States to ensure that individuals have access to alternative housing in cases of eviction, particularly in situations involving vulnerable individuals such as single mothers with minor children. It emphasizes the importance of fulfilling international obligations in the area of housing and providing effective remedies for violations of the right to adequate housing.
