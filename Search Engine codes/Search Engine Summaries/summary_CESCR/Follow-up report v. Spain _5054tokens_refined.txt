Combined Summary:

Case Details:
- Case ID: E/C.12/72/3
- Court/Tribunal: United Nations Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (UNCESCR)
- Document Date: 11 November 2022
- Key Parties Involved: El Ayoubi et al. v. Spain
- Case Name: El Ayoubi et al. v. Spain
- Case Summary: The authors of the communication received an eviction order for occupying a property illegally. They claimed that the eviction constituted a violation of article 11 (1) of the Covenant, as the order did not take into account their situation of necessity and lack of access to alternative housing. The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights found that Spain had violated the authors' rights and recommended that Spain provide the authors with an effective remedy, including reassessing their state of necessity and providing them with adequate housing.

Procedural History:
The case concerns the eviction of a family of four from their social housing apartment in Madrid, Spain. The family consists of Ms. El Ayoubi, her husband Mr. El Azouan Azouz, and their two children. The family's eviction was ordered due to their failure to meet the annual income threshold for social housing eligibility. The authors argue that the State party's measures are only temporary and do not resolve the underlying problem of the housing crisis.

Legal Analysis and Reasoning:
The authors claim that the competent housing authorities of the Community of Madrid have not even tried to assist them in their negotiations with the owner of the property. They also state that the number of successful applications for social housing is low because of the regulations in force, which prevent families who are occupying a property without the owner's consent from applying for social housing.

Decisions and Rulings:
The Committee recommends that the State party remove the obstacles preventing the authors from applying for housing so that recommendation (a) may be implemented in full. The Committee requests the State party to reassess the authors' state of necessity and level of priority on the waiting list, taking into account their application for housing with the Community of Madrid, starting from the date on which they applied.

Impact and Significance:
The Committee's recommendations have significant implications for the housing rights of individuals and families in Spain. The case sets a precedent for the assessment of state of necessity and priority on waiting lists for social housing, and highlights the need for effective remedies for violations of housing rights.
