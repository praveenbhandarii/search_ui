- Case Name: M.J.M.F. v. Spain
- Case Summary: The author, M.J.M.F., submitted a communication to the Committee on behalf of herself and her minor children, alleging violation of their right to adequate housing due to eviction from social rental housing that was subsequently sold to a private fund.

Procedural History:
The communication was submitted on 11 October 2018, and the Committee requested the State party to take interim measures to suspend the eviction of the author and her children pending the consideration of the communication or to provide them with adequate alternative housing. The Committee discontinued its consideration of the communication on 12 October 2021, due to the author's failure to respond to repeated requests for comments on the State party's observations.

Legal Analysis and Reasoning:
The legal issue addressed in this case was the right to adequate housing under Article 11(1) of the Covenant. The Committee's analysis focused on the failure of the author to respond to the State party's observations, in accordance with rule 17 of its provisional rules of procedure under the Optional Protocol.

Decisions and Rulings:
The Committee discontinued its consideration of the communication due to the author's failure to respond to the State party's observations.

Impact and Significance:
The discontinuation of the consideration of the communication sets a precedent for the importance of timely and thorough responses to the State party's observations in cases brought before the Committee. It also highlights the significance of genuine consultation with the author in providing adequate alternative housing in cases of eviction.
