Case Name: Maribel Viviana López Albán v. Spain

Procedural History:
The author, Maribel Viviana López Albán, a Spanish national, filed a communication with the UNCESCR claiming that her eviction from her home by the bank that owns the apartment, following a criminal conviction for unlawful appropriation, violated her rights under Article 11(1) of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. The Committee, acting through its Working Group, registered the communication and requested the State party to suspend the eviction of the author and her children while the communication was being considered, or alternatively, to provide them with adequate housing in genuine consultation with the author.

Legal Analysis and Reasoning:
The case concerns the eviction of the author and her children from their home due to non-payment of rent, as well as the rejection of the author's application for social housing due to her occupation of a property without legal title. The Committee found that the State party violated the rights of the author and her children under Article 11(1) of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. The Committee also noted that the eviction was carried out without a prior assessment of the proportionality between the aim pursued by the measure and its consequences for the evicted persons.

Decisions and Rulings:
The Committee recommended that the State party provide the author and her children with an effective remedy, including reassessing their application for housing, providing financial compensation, and reimbursing legal costs. The Committee also recommended that the State party take steps to prevent similar violations in the future, including guaranteeing non-repetition.

Impact and Significance:
The Committee's Views and recommendations were requested to be published and distributed widely in Spain. This case sets a precedent for the protection of the right to adequate housing and the obligation of States parties to ensure access to alternative housing for individuals facing eviction.
