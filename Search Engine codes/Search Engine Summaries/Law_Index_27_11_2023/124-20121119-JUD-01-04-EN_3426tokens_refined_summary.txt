Title: Territorial and Maritime Dispute (Nicaragua v. Colombia)

Case Overview:
The case involves a territorial and maritime dispute between Nicaragua and Colombia in the Caribbean Sea. The Republic of Nicaragua filed an Application in 2001, initiating proceedings against the Republic of Colombia. The dispute concerns title to territory and maritime delimitation. Colombia filed preliminary objections to jurisdiction, leading to the suspension of the proceedings on the merits.

Important Details:
- The International Court of Justice (ICJ) is hearing the case.
- The ICJ has to delimit the boundary between Nicaragua and Colombia based on the principles of equity.
- The Court used a three-stage method to delimit the boundary, including the construction of a provisional median line, its adjustment or shifting, and the final delimitation of the boundary.
- The provisional median line was deemed inappropriate, so the Court adjusted the line by giving a weighting of 1 to each Colombian base point and a weighting of 3 to each Nicaraguan base point.
- The Court used a 3:1 ratio method to adjust the line.
- The boundary was delimited in two sections: the northern part using the parallel of latitude passing through the northernmost point on the 12-nautical-mile envelope of arc around Roncador, and the southern part using the 12-nautical-mile arcs drawn around the South Cay of Alburquerque Cays and East South-East Cays.
- The Court's approach in delimiting the boundary has been questioned, as it may be seen as a departure from the standard method.
- The case highlights the challenges in delimiting boundaries between countries with disparate coast lengths and the need for an equitable solution.
- The Court has taken into account the interests of third States in the region, particularly Costa Rica and Panama.
