Title: Whaling in the Antarctic (Australia v. Japan: New Zealand intervening)

Case Overview:
This case involves Australia's challenge against Japan's large-scale whaling program, known as JARPA II, in the Antarctic. Australia argues that Japan's program violates its obligations under the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling (ICRW) and other international obligations for the preservation of marine mammals and the marine environment.

Document Overview:
This judgment document, issued by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) on March 31, 2014, reviews Japan's decision to grant special permits for JARPA II. The document provides details about the case, including the case number (148), judges involved, and citation information (I.C.J. Reports 2014 (I), p. 532).

Important Details:
- The dispute revolves around the interpretation of Article VIII, paragraph 1, of the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling, which grants contracting governments the discretion to grant special permits for scientific whaling.
- The Court's reasoning on alleged violations of the Schedule lacks coherence, according to Judge Xue, who provides a separate opinion.
- The International Whaling Commission (IWC) has the power to grant special permits for scientific purposes under Article VIII of the Convention.
- The authorizing state has discretion in granting special permits, but this power is not unlimited and must avoid adverse effects on whale stocks and ensure sustainable utilization and conservation of resources.
- The Court ruled that the determination of whether the killing, taking, and treating of whales under a special permit is for scientific research cannot solely depend on the authorizing state's perception.
- The Court found that Japan failed to prove the duly conducted feasibility studies on nonlethal methods and that the target sample sizes for JARPA II were larger than reasonable.
- Japan's decision to grant special permits for JARPA II was deemed not objectively reasonable and violated the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling.

Additional Information:
- The ICJ emphasized the importance of conservation for the protection of whale resources and the evolving restrictions on commercial whaling for conservation purposes.
- The ICJ acknowledged that scientific whaling programs may have flaws or shortcomings but emphasized the need for compliance with the Convention's requirements.
- Japan was given the opportunity to address the design and implementation shortcomings of JARPA II during the upcoming periodical review by the Scientific Committee.
