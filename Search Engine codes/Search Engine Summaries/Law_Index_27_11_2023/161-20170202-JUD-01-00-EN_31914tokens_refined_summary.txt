Title: Maritime Delimitation in the Indian Ocean (Somalia v. Kenya)

Case Overview:
This case involves a dispute between Somalia and Kenya regarding the delimitation of maritime spaces in the Indian Ocean. Somalia filed an application with the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in 2014, seeking the determination of a single maritime boundary between the two countries based on international law. The case centers around the interpretation and legal status of a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) signed between the parties in 2009. The ICJ issued a preliminary objections judgment on February 2, 2017, addressing Kenya's objections to the admissibility of Somalia's application and affirming the Court's jurisdiction to entertain the case.

Important Details:
- The dispute between Somalia and Kenya regards the delimitation of their maritime boundary, specifically the continental shelf beyond 200 nautical miles.
- The MOU signed in 2009 established a framework for cooperation in the delimitation of the maritime boundary.
- The ICJ analyzed the legal status and interpretation of the MOU, as well as the distinction between delineation and delimitation.
- Kenya argued that the MOU precluded negotiations on maritime delimitation before the Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf (CLCS) made its recommendations.
- The ICJ rejected Kenya's argument, stating that the MOU did not prevent the parties from engaging in negotiations before the CLCS's recommendations.
- The ICJ found that the MOU did not establish a dispute settlement procedure for the determination of the maritime boundary.
- The Court's judgment addressed Kenya's objections to the admissibility of Somalia's application and affirmed the Court's jurisdiction to entertain the case.

Document Details:
This judgment is a preliminary objections judgment issued by the ICJ on February 2, 2017. The case number is 161, and the document provides details about the parties involved, the judges, and the case background. The MOU between Somalia and Kenya, signed in 2009, is a central focus of the analysis. Dissenting opinions were appended to the judgment by Judges Bennouna, Robinson, Gaja, Crawford, and Judge ad hoc Guillaume.

Additional Information:
- The case is ongoing, with the Court considering the issue of whether the MOU constitutes a treaty in force between the parties.
- The case involves complex issues of international law, including the customary international law of treaties and the applicable law to be used in determining the maritime boundary.
- The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) governs the maritime boundary dispute between Somalia and Kenya.
- The ICJ will consider previous case law and scholarly commentary to inform its decision on the jurisdiction of the court over a maritime boundary dispute under UNCLOS.
