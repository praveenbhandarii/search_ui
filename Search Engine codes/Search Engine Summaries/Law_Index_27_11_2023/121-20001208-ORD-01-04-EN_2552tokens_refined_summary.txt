Title: Arrest Warrant of 11 April 2000 (Democratic Republic of the Congo v. Belgium)

Case Overview:
The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) filed a dispute against Belgium regarding an international arrest warrant issued against the acting Congolese Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr. Abdoulaye Yerodia Ndombasi. The DRC alleged that the warrant sought his detention and extradition to Belgium for crimes constituting grave violations of international humanitarian law.

Important Details:
- The DRC did not comply with Article 38, paragraph 2 of the Rules of Court, which requires specifying the legal grounds for the Court's jurisdiction.
- The Court cannot consider the DRC's invocation of its optional clause declaration in the second round of oral arguments as a new title to support the Court's jurisdiction.
- Belgium was not prejudiced by the DRC's invocation of its optional clause declarations in the second round of oral arguments.
- The optional clause declarations made by Belgium and the DRC were only reproduced in the Yearbook of the Court and were not explicitly mentioned in the Application.
- The DRC invoked its optional clause declaration in the second round of oral arguments but did not do so in the present case.
