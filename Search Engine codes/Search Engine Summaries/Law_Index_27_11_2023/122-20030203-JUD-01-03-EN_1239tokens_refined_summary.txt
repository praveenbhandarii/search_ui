Title: Application for Revision of the Judgment of 11 July 1996 in the Case concerning Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Bosnia and Herzegovina v. Yugoslavia), Preliminary Objections (Yugoslavia v. Bosnia and Herzegovina)

Case Overview:
This case involves an application for the revision of a judgment delivered by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) on 11 July 1996. The original case was brought by Bosnia and Herzegovina against Yugoslavia, and the ICJ had declared its jurisdiction based on the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide. Yugoslavia now seeks a revision of the judgment, arguing that it was not the proper respondent in the case due to a factual error and that new facts have emerged since the original judgment.

Important Details:
- Yugoslavia filed an application for the revision of the ICJ's judgment on 11 July 1996.
- The original judgment declared the ICJ's jurisdiction based on the Genocide Convention and dismissed additional bases of jurisdiction raised by Bosnia and Herzegovina.
- Yugoslavia argues that it should not have been the respondent in the original case, as it did not continue the international legal and political personality of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.
- Yugoslavia claims that it was not a member of the United Nations, a party to the Statute of the Court, or a party to the Genocide Convention before 1 November 2000.
- The request for revision is made under Article 61 of the ICJ Statute.
- The key arguments presented by Yugoslavia include the factual error in the identification of the respondent and the potential impact of the United Nations' classification of the former Yugoslavia as a grey area in 2000.
