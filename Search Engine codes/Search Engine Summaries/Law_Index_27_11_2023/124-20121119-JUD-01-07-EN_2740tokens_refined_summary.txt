Document Details:
The document is a judgment from the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in the case of Territorial and Maritime Dispute (Nicaragua v. Colombia). It was delivered on July 14, 2014, by a majority of the ICJ's judges. The judgment clarifies the legal framework for the delimitation of continental shelves and the relationship between UNCLOS and customary international law. It cites various provisions of UNCLOS, including Articles 74, 76, 83, and 121, as well as the Convention's Preamble. The judge ad hoc for this case was Judge Cot, and the document is cited as ICJ Reports 2014, pp. 293-321.

Additional Information:
The ICJ held that coastal states along the Caribbean Sea, including Nicaragua, are not parties to the Convention on the Continental Shelf and cannot be affected by its procedures for determining the outer limit of the continental shelf. The court further stated that it should have confined itself to examining the evidence presented during the judicial proceedings to reject Nicaragua's claim for a delimitation of its continental shelf beyond 200 nautical miles. Judge ad hoc Mensah supported the ICJ's views on this point. The document includes a citation of the case as "151 6 CIJ1034" and was signed by Jean-Pierre Cot on January 7, 2014.
