Title: Territorial and Maritime Dispute (Nicaragua v. Colombia)

Case Overview:
The case involves a territorial and maritime dispute between Nicaragua and Colombia. Nicaragua filed an Application in 2001, alleging a dispute concerning title to territory and maritime delimitation. Colombia filed preliminary objections to jurisdiction, leading to the suspension of the proceedings on the merits.

Important Details:
- Nicaragua brought the action based on the violation of the 1928 Treaty and sought a declaratory judgment on the basis of the treaty and its possessory and sovereign title.
- Colombia opposed the action, seeking a declaration that the 1928 Treaty was valid and that the controversy should be declared ended.
- The International Court of Justice ruled that Nicaragua's possession of the islands was not proven and that Colombia's title to the islands was based on the valid 1928 Treaty.
- The Court also ruled that Nicaragua's arguments on the nullity of the treaty were not admissible and that the dispute should be resolved diplomatically.
- The Court's decision was based on the principle of proportionality and the consent of the parties.
- The case highlights the importance of procedural fairness and the need for clarity and precision in legal submissions.
- The ruling has implications for the resolution of the territorial status of the islands and the relationship between Colombia and Nicaragua.
