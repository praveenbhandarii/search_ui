Title: Whaling in the Antarctic (Australia v. Japan: New Zealand intervening)

Case Overview:
Australia initiated proceedings against Japan on May 31, 2010, alleging that Japan's large-scale whaling program, known as JARPA II, violated its obligations under the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling (ICRW) and other international obligations for the preservation of marine mammals and the marine environment.

Document Overview:
This judgment document pertains to the case between the International Whaling Commission (IWC) and Japan. It includes details such as the IWC resolutions 20033 and 20051, the Schedule to the ICRW, and relevant provisions such as Article VIII of the ICRW, paragraph 30 of the Schedule, and Rule M (4 (a)) of the IWC's Rules of Procedure. The document does not specify the date or the judges involved in the case.

Important Details:
- Japan launched JARPA II, a scientific whaling program in the Antarctic, without waiting for the completion of the review of JARPA by the Scientific Committee.
- Japan failed to duly consider the comments and recommendations of the IWC regarding certain controversial aspects of JARPA II.
- Article VIII of the ICRW requires Contracting Governments to report authorizations for special permit whaling to the IWC and transmit scientific information resulting from the research conducted under those permits.
- Paragraph 30 of the Schedule mandates Contracting Governments to submit proposed special permits to the IWC and the Scientific Committee for review before issuance.
- Rule M (4 (a)) of the IWC's Rules of Procedure requires the Scientific Committee to review and comment on proposed special permits and submit its report and recommendations to the IWC.
- Meaningful cooperation with the IWC involves submitting proposed special permits in a timely manner, considering the views and recommendations of the IWC and the Scientific Committee, providing accurate information on program modifications, and offering collaboration opportunities to other researchers.
- Based on the evidence presented, Japan failed to comply with the required procedures in relation to JARPA II and did not demonstrate meaningful cooperation with the IWC in the regulation of whaling.

Additional Information:
The case highlights the importance of meaningful cooperation between states and the IWC in the regulation of whaling activities. It emphasizes the need for adherence to the ICRW, the Schedule, and the recommendations of the IWC and its Scientific Committee.
