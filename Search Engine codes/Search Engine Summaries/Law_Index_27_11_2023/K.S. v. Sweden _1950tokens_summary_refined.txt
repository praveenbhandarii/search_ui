- Key Parties Involved: K.S. (author) and Sweden (state party)
- Case Name: K.S. v. Sweden

Procedural History:
The author, a national of Afghanistan, was denied asylum in Sweden and faced removal to Afghanistan. The author claimed that their removal would breach their rights under articles 15, 16, 22, 25, 26, and 27 of the Convention due to the absence of medical facilities adapted to their needs in Afghanistan. The state party argued that the communication was inadmissible ratione materiae and ratione loci, and that the author had not exhausted domestic remedies.

Legal Analysis and Reasoning:
The Committee noted that the author's psychological situation had deteriorated after their asylum application was rejected, and that their removal to Afghanistan would pose a risk to their life and health. The Committee also noted that the absence of medical facilities adapted to the author's needs in Afghanistan would breach their rights under articles 15, 16, 22, 25, 26, and 27 of the Convention. The Committee found that the state party had not provided sufficient reasons for the author's removal to Afghanistan, and that the communication was admissible under article 23 of the Convention.

Decisions and Rulings:
The Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities considered the communication and decided to discontinue the consideration of communication No. 55/2018, as the subject matter of the communication had become moot.

Impact and Significance:
The decision highlights the importance of considering the rights of individuals with disabilities in the context of asylum and removal proceedings. It also underscores the importance of ensuring that appropriate medical facilities are available to individuals with disabilities in the country to which they are being removed.
