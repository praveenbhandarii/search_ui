Title: Whaling in the Antarctic (Australia v. Japan: New Zealand intervening)

Case Overview:
Australia initiated proceedings against Japan in 2010, alleging that Japan's whaling program (JARPA II) in the Antarctic violated its obligations under the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling (ICRW) and other international obligations for the preservation of marine mammals and the marine environment.

Document Overview:
This document is a judgment from the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in Case Number 148. It was issued on March 31, 2014. The judges presiding over the case were President Owada, Vice President Tom, Judges Keith, Buergenthal, Higgins, and Sir Raymond. The document provides a detailed analysis of the case, including the court's findings and reasoning.

Important Details:
- The main issue in the case was the compatibility of Japan's whaling program (JARPA II) with the ICRW.
- Australia argued that the ICRW had evolved into a conservation-oriented regime, while Japan emphasized the orderly development of the whaling industry.
- The court found that JARPA II was not within the exception in Article VIII, paragraph 1, of the ICRW, and Japan was in breach of its obligations under paragraphs 7(b), 10(d), and 10(e) of the Schedule.
- The court's finding was based on the language of the Convention, its traveaux preparatoires, and the lack of support for Japan's interpretation in the Commission's resolutions.
- The ICJ concluded that Japan's whaling activities under JARPA II were not compatible with its international legal obligations.

Additional Information:
- The ICJ also considered the case of The Institute for Cetacean Research v. Australia, which involved the same whaling program and similar legal arguments.
- The ICJ found that Japan's whaling activities under JARPA II violated the provisions of the ICRW and the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES).
- The court highlighted that the meat from whales taken under JARPA II was sold in Japan, indicating a commercial activity that violated the Convention.
- The ICJ noted that Japan had not adapted its research program to changed circumstances and had not seriously assessed the required sample size.
- The court's decision emphasized the importance of carefully considering jurisdictional objections and the significance of declarations made under Article 36(2) of the Statute.
- The Court refused Japan's request for a second round of written argument, finding that no additional documents or evidence were necessary.
- The decision highlights the importance of carefully considering the nature of jurisdictional objections and the need for additional written argument, as well as the court's discretion in granting such requests.

Overall, this document provides a comprehensive analysis of the Australia v. Japan case regarding whaling in the Antarctic. The ICJ found Japan in breach of its obligations under the ICRW and CITES, highlighting the need for sustainable whaling practices and conservation efforts. The decision also underscores the importance of considering jurisdictional objections and the court's discretion in granting requests for additional written argument.
