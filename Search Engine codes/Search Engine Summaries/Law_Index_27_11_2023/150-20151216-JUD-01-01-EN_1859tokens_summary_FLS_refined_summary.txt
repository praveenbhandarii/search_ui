Title: Costa Rica v. Nicaragua - Judgment of December 23, 1984 (ICJ Reports 1984/160) - International Court of Justice - Judges: Mohammed Bedjaoui (Vice President), Gilbert Guillaume, Stephen M. Schwebel, Jos R. Torresola, Louis R. Gompertz, and Robert Y. Jennings

Overview:
This document pertains to the case of Costa Rica v. Nicaragua, which was heard by the International Court of Justice in 1984. The judgment, issued on December 23, 1984, emphasizes the principle of territorial integrity, which is enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations and customary international law. The document highlights the breach of this principle by the organization of irregular forces or armed bands for incursion into the territory of another State. It also underscores the inviolability of the sovereign equality of States, territorial integrity, and political independence. The Court's previous case law, including the Corfu Channel case and the Accordance with International Law of the Unilateral Declaration of Independence in Respect of Kosovo case, has emphasized the importance of the principle of territorial integrity. The document argues that failure to recognize this principle is inconsistent with the Court's previous case law.
