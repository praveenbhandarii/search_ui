Title: Territorial and Maritime Dispute (Nicaragua v. Colombia)

Case Overview:
The case involves a territorial and maritime dispute between Nicaragua and Colombia in the Caribbean Sea and the Pacific Ocean. The dispute centers around sovereignty over maritime features, delimitation of the continental shelf and exclusive economic zone, and the applicability of customary international law and the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). The International Court of Justice (ICJ) has been involved in resolving the dispute since 2001.

Important Details:
- The dispute relates to the delimitation of the continental shelf between Colombia and Nicaragua.
- The Court is analyzing the relevant circumstances to arrive at an equitable solution, considering factors such as the disparity in coastal lengths, the proximity of the coasts, and the complexity of the case.
- The ICJ has determined the boundary line between the territorial sea and exclusive economic zone of Nicaragua and the Colombian territorial sea around Quitasueo.
- Colombia has sovereignty over the islands at Alburquerque, Bajo Nuevo, East-Southeast Cays, Quitasueo, Roncador, Serrana, and Serranilla.
- The Court has shifted the provisional median line to reflect the disparity in coastal lengths and constructed a weighted line using a 3:1 ratio between Nicaraguan and Colombian base points.
- The simplified weighted line forms the boundary between the maritime entitlements of the two States.
- The ICJ has considered both the disparity in coastal length and the need to avoid cutting off either state from the maritime spaces into which their coasts project to achieve an equitable result.
- Nicaragua's claim for a maritime boundary delimiting the continental shelf and exclusive economic zones has been rejected by the Court.
- The ICJ has decided that the maritime boundary line shall continue due east along the parallel of latitude until it reaches the 200 nautical mile limit from the baselines, and then continue along an envelope of arcs.

Document Details:
This judgment document, dated November 19, 2012, is part of the ICJ Reports of Judgments, Advisory Opinions and Orders. It provides the case number (General List No. 124) and includes key issues such as sovereignty over maritime features, delimitation of the continental shelf and exclusive economic zone, and the applicability of customary international law and UNCLOS. The document also includes the names of the judges who heard the case, including President Tomka.

Additional Information:
- The case has been ongoing since 2001 and has involved multiple parties and legal advisers representing Nicaragua and Colombia.
- The ICJ allowed several governments to access the pleadings and documents annexed in the case, including Honduras, Jamaica, Chile, Peru, Ecuador, Venezuela, and Costa Rica.
- The judgment determined the method of delimitation of the maritime boundary between Nicaragua and Colombia in the Caribbean Sea and the Pacific Ocean.
- Nicaragua's request for a declaration of Colombia's unlawful conduct and a maritime delimitation de novo was rejected by the Court.
- The case involves the Quitasueo group of features in the Caribbean Sea, and the Court needed to determine whether there are any naturally formed areas of land above water at high tide in Quitasueo.
- The ICJ has considered the parties' arguments regarding tidal variation and the effect of such variation on the status of the maritime features.
- The case is still ongoing, and the ICJ has not yet made a final ruling on the maritime entitlements of the parties.
