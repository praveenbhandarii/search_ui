Title: Application for Revision of the Judgment of 11 July 1996 in the Case concerning Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Bosnia and Herzegovina v. Yugoslavia), Preliminary Objections (Yugoslavia v. Bosnia and Herzegovina)

Case Overview:
This case involves an application for the revision of a judgment delivered by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) on 11 July 1996. The judgment pertained to preliminary objections raised by Yugoslavia in a case brought against it by Bosnia and Herzegovina. Yugoslavia argues that a revision of the judgment is necessary due to new evidence regarding its international legal and political personality, United Nations membership, and status as a party to the Genocide Convention.

Important Details:
- Yugoslavia filed an application for revision of the ICJ judgment on 24 April 2001.
- The ICJ had declared its jurisdiction based on Article IX of the Genocide Convention in the 1996 judgment.
- Yugoslavia claims that it did not continue the international legal and political personality of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia before 1 November 2000.
- Yugoslavia argues that it was not a member of the United Nations, nor a party to the Statute of the Court or the Genocide Convention at the time of the 1996 judgment.
- The revision procedure under Article 61 of the ICJ Statute is not a challenge to earlier legal conclusions but aims to consider fresh evidence or arguments.
- The applicant contends that the ICJ's assumption of Yugoslavia's UN membership in 1996 was incorrect, and that Yugoslavia was not a party to the Genocide Convention.

Document Details:
This judgment document pertains to the application for revision of the ICJ judgment in the case between Bosnia and Herzegovina and Yugoslavia. It provides details about the case number, case name, parties involved, key facts, legal arguments, jurisdiction, judges, and other relevant information. The document date is 3 February 2003.

Additional Information:
The application for revision is based on the premise that Yugoslavia was not a party to the Genocide Convention and that its UN membership and status as a party to the Statute of the Court and the Genocide Convention were crucial to the ICJ's jurisdiction. The author argues that the admission of Yugoslavia to the UN in November 2000 has legal implications for the 1996 judgment and suggests that the Court should be willing to revise its earlier judgment in light of new facts that have emerged.
