Title: Arrest Warrant of 11 April 2000 (Democratic Republic of the Congo v. Belgium)

Case Overview:
The case involves a dispute between the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and Belgium regarding an international arrest warrant issued by Belgium against the acting Congolese Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr. Abdoulaye Yerodia Ndombasi. The warrant sought his detention and subsequent extradition to Belgium for alleged crimes constituting "grave violations of international humanitarian law". The DRC filed an Application instituting proceedings against Belgium, challenging the warrant.

- The DRC received the arrest warrant on 12 July 2000.
- The DRC withdrew its original first submission, leading the Court to address the question of universal jurisdiction.
