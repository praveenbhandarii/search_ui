Case Summary:
The petitioner, a black Frenchman, was denied a job opportunity at Renault due to racial discrimination. The petitioner alleges that the State party failed to ensure that Renault complied with the ICERD, and that the company's internal documents show a systematic and systemic discrimination against certain categories of employees based on their ethnic origin. The petitioner claims that the State party violated Article 2, 3, 4, and 5 of the ICERD, regarding nondiscrimination, equal protection under the law, the elimination of racial segregation, and the protection of the petitioner's fundamental rights.

Legal Analysis and Reasoning:
The UNHRC found that the petitioner's claims were admissible and that the State party had violated the ICERD by failing to ensure that Renault complied with the Convention. The Committee held that the State party had failed to demonstrate that it had taken adequate measures to prevent and address the discrimination faced by the petitioner, and that the petitioner had exhausted all available domestic remedies. The Committee recommended that the State party take all necessary measures to eliminate discrimination within Renault and provide the petitioner with adequate compensation.

Legal Analysis and Reasoning:
The petitioner alleged a violation of articles 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (ICERD) by Renault, a public limited company in France. The petitioner provided evidence of systematic discrimination within Renault, including internal documents that introduced an ethnic codification system based on skin color and ethnic origin. The petitioner claimed that the State party failed to ensure Renault's compliance with the ICERD and allowed discrimination to be practiced against individuals or groups of individuals on the basis of their ethnic or geographical origin. The UNHRC found the petitioner's claims admissible and held that the State party had violated the ICERD by failing to ensure Renault's compliance with the Convention and by not taking adequate measures to prevent and address the discrimination faced by the petitioner. The Committee also noted that the failure to reclassify the petitioner could have a direct impact on the calculation of his pay during the period when he was subjected to discrimination on account of his ethnic origin.

Decisions and Rulings:
The UNHRC adopted its views on the case and found that the State party had violated the ICERD. The Committee recommended that the State party take all necessary measures to eliminate discrimination within Renault and provide the petitioner with adequate compensation. The Committee also recommended that the reclassification of employees who are the victims of racial discrimination be explicitly taken into account in the assessment of awards of damages.

Impact and Significance:
The case highlights the issue of racial discrimination in employment and the obligation of States to provide effective remedies to victims of discrimination. The UNHRC's decision emphasizes the importance of taking effective measures to prevent and address discrimination and sets a precedent for addressing racial discrimination in the workplace. The case also underscores the need for adequate compensation for victims of discrimination and the consideration of reclassification in the assessment of damages.
