Summary:

Case Details:
The case of Mohammed Hassan Gelle v. Denmark involves a complaint filed by the petitioner, a Danish citizen of Somali origin, against Denmark for comparing persons of Somali origin to paedophiles and rapists in a letter to the editor. The petitioner claims that the comparison equated persons of Somali origin with criminals, violating their rights and culture. The State party argues that the comparison was not racially discriminatory and that the petitioner failed to establish a prima facie case for purposes of admissibility. The Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination held that the comparison equating persons of Somali origin to paedophiles and rapists was a form of racial discrimination and constituted a violation of articles 2, paragraph 1 (d), 4 and 6 of the Convention. The decision sets a precedent for the interpretation of the Convention and the protection of minority groups from hate speech.

Procedural History:
The case was brought before the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination (CERD) as a communication from the petitioner, Mohammed Hassan Gelle, against the Danish State. The petitioner claimed that a statement made by a Member of Parliament, Ms. Kjrsgaard, was racist and violated the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (CERD). The State party argued that the communication was inadmissible as the petitioner had not exhausted all available domestic remedies.

Legal Analysis and Reasoning:
The Committee found that the comparison made by Ms. Kjrsgaard, equating persons of Somali origin to paedophiles and rapists, constituted a form of racial discrimination and violated articles 2, paragraph 1 (d), 4 and 6 of the Convention. The Committee rejected the State party's argument that the petitioner had not exhausted all available domestic remedies, as the petitioner had demonstrated that judicial review of the Regional Public Prosecutor's decision would not have provided an effective remedy. The Committee also found that the State party's argument that the statements were not racially discriminatory was not persuasive, as the statements could be understood as degrading or insulting to an entire group of people based solely on their ethnic or national origin. The Committee emphasized that the fact that the statements were made in the context of a political debate did not absolve the State party from its obligation to investigate whether or not the statements amounted to racial discrimination.

Decisions and Rulings:
The Committee ruled that Denmark had violated articles 2, paragraph 1 (d), 4 and 6 of the Convention by failing to effectively investigate and address the incident of racial discrimination. The Committee called on Denmark to provide the petitioner with an effective remedy, including appropriate compensation, and to take measures to prevent similar violations in the future.

Impact and Significance:
The decision in this case sets a precedent for the interpretation of the Convention and the protection of minority groups from hate speech. It highlights the importance of effective investigation and prosecution of incidents of racial discrimination and the responsibility of public officials, including Members of Parliament, to refrain from making statements that may promote or condone racial discrimination.
