Title: Whaling in the Antarctic (Australia v. Japan: New Zealand intervening)

Case Overview:
Australia initiated proceedings against Japan on May 31, 2010, alleging that Japan's large-scale whaling program in the Antarctic, known as JARPA II, violated its obligations under the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling (ICRW) and other international obligations for the preservation of marine mammals and the marine environment.

Document Overview:
This judgment type document is a legal opinion delivered by Judge Ad Hoc Charlesworth on May 18, 2015. It addresses the interpretation of Article VIII of the ICRW regarding the use of lethal methods for scientific research. The document also highlights the precautionary approach to interpretation, the duty of cooperation between states parties to the ICRW, and the relevance of IWC resolutions and guidelines.

Important Details:
- Judge Ad Hoc Charlesworth emphasized the precautionary approach to interpretation and the duty of cooperation between states parties to the ICRW.
- The judge disagreed with the majority's view on the nature of restrictions on lethal methods in scientific research on whales, arguing for nonlethal methods to be given primacy.
- IWC resolutions and guidelines, including resolution 19862 and Annex P, establish the principle that lethal methods should be used only when other methods are not available.
- The judge highlighted the evolution of the ICRW, the adoption of amendments to the Schedule, and the relevance of IWC recommendations.
- The International Court of Justice (ICJ) has considered the principle of using nonlethal methods in scientific research, but resolutions adopted by consensus do not establish a requirement for nonlethal methods.
- The ICJ referred to the precautionary approach in environmental regulation and its application in international environmental law.
- The duty of cooperation among states parties to the ICRW is critical, and Japan's compliance with paragraph 30 of the Schedule to the ICRW was disputed.
- The IWC has the power to regulate whaling through amending the Schedule and requires states to cooperate by providing permits, engaging in international scientific collaboration, and considering IWC resolutions in good faith.
- Japan's JARPA II program was launched without a review by the Scientific Committee, lacked opportunities for international collaboration, and did not consider non-lethal methods.
- Hilary Charlesworth opined that Japan breached paragraph 30 and the Court should not accept Japan's argument of meeting the requirements.
- The document contains citations and was signed by Hilary Charlesworth.

Additional Information:
The International Agreement for the Regulation of Whaling and its amendments have been in force since 1948 and have been ratified by over 50 countries. The IWC, with 85 member countries, meets annually to discuss and adopt resolutions on whaling-related issues. The Scientific Committee provides scientific advice, and the Schedule to the ICRW sets out provisions for the regulation of whaling, including protected species and conditions for lethal whaling for scientific research.
