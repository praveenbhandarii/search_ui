Title: Application for Revision of the Judgment of 11 July 1996 in the Case concerning Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Bosnia and Herzegovina v. Yugoslavia), Preliminary Objections (Yugoslavia v. Bosnia and Herzegovina)

Case Overview:
This case involves an application for revision of a judgment delivered by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) on 11 July 1996. The judgment concerned the preliminary objections raised by Yugoslavia in a case brought against it by Bosnia and Herzegovina. Yugoslavia argued that a revision of the judgment was necessary due to its non-membership in the United Nations and its non-party status to the Genocide Convention. The ICJ had previously declared that it had jurisdiction based on the Genocide Convention, but Yugoslavia now claimed that it did not continue the international legal and political personality of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.

Important Details:
- The case revolves around whether Yugoslavia is a party to the Genocide Convention and bound by its provisions.
- The ICJ had previously found that Yugoslavia was bound by the Genocide Convention on the date of the application filing.
- The question of Yugoslavia's membership in the United Nations and the Genocide Convention was not definitively decided.
- The ICJ based its judgment solely on the Geneva Convention, which limits the Court's jurisdiction to members of the United Nations and non-member states invited by the General Assembly.
- The ICJ reserved judgment on Yugoslavia's membership for future consideration.
- The new context reveals that Yugoslavia was not a member of the United Nations at the relevant time and applied for revision based on the discovery of this new fact.
- The ICJ held that the fact of Yugoslavia's non-membership in the UN at the time of the 1996 judgment could not have been established before the decision of the General Assembly on November 1, 2000.
- The ICJ found that the FRY's application for UN membership was not based on the discovery of a new fact, but rather on its longstanding attempts to assert its status as the continuator of the former Yugoslavia.
- The ICJ held that the FRY was not negligent in its attempts to pursue its national interests.
- The ICJ noted that the assumption of Yugoslavia's membership in the UN at the time of the Court's judgment on its jurisdiction cannot be sustained after November 1, 2000.
- The ICJ held that residual elements of the membership of the former Yugoslavia cannot frustrate this conclusion.
