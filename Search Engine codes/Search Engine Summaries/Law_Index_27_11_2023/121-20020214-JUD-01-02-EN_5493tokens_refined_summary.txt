Title: Arrest Warrant of 11 April 2000 (Democratic Republic of the Congo v. Belgium)

Case Overview:
The case involves a dispute between the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and Belgium regarding an international arrest warrant issued against the acting Congolese Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr. Abdoulaye Yerodia Ndombasi. The DRC filed an application with the International Court of Justice (ICJ) alleging violations of international humanitarian law. The case raises important legal issues such as sovereign equality, non-intervention, diplomatic immunity, and universal jurisdiction.

Important Details:
- The DRC filed an application on 17 October 2000, claiming that Belgium violated sovereign equality and non-intervention by exercising criminal jurisdiction over Mr. Yerodia.
- The DRC argued that Belgium's actions also violated the principles of universal jurisdiction and diplomatic immunity.
- The ICJ initially rejected the DRC's application but later reversed its decision and accepted the case.
- The case has implications for the interpretation of the ICJ's compulsory jurisdiction and the principle of state sovereignty.
- Judge Oda dissented, arguing that the ICJ lacked jurisdiction over the matter and regretting his previous vote in favor of hearing the case.
- The ICJ ultimately held that the case did not involve a legal dispute between the DRC and Belgium and that the DRC's request was merely an asking of the Court to render an opinion.
