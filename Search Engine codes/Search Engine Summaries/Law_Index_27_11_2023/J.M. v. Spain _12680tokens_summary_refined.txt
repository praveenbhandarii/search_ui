Case Summary:
The case involves a complaint filed by J.M. against Spain, alleging violations of his rights under the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. J.M., a former police officer, was declared permanently disabled and mandatorily retired following a traffic accident. He requested reasonable accommodation to continue working in a modified capacity, but his request was denied. The Committee found that Spain violated several provisions of the Convention and failed to provide reasonable accommodation.

Legal Analysis and Reasoning:
- J.M. argued that Spain violated various articles of the Convention, as well as the Constitution, by failing to provide effective legal protection and reasonable accommodation.
- Spain contended that J.M.'s retirement was necessary due to his permanent disability and that the denial of modified duty was not discriminatory.
- The Committee found that Spain failed to demonstrate the necessity and proportionality of J.M.'s retirement and the denial of reasonable accommodation.
- The Committee emphasized the State party's obligation to provide reasonable accommodation and assess the fitness of individuals with disabilities for alternative duties.
