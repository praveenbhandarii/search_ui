Title: Land Boundary in the Northern Part of Isla Portillos (Costa Rica v. Nicaragua)

Case Overview:
This case, numbered 165, involves a dispute between Costa Rica and Nicaragua regarding the precise definition of the land boundary in the area of Los Portillos/Harbor Head Lagoon and Nicaragua's establishment of a new military camp on the beach of Isla Portillos. Costa Rica filed an application with the International Court of Justice (ICJ) on January 16, 2017, seeking resolution of the dispute.

Important Details:
- Key issues: The precise location of the land boundary separating the Harbor Head Lagoon sandbar from Isla Portillos, the course of the land boundary in the northern part of Isla Portillos, and whether Nicaragua's military presence on the beach violates Costa Rica's territorial sovereignty.
- Relevant provisions: 1858 Treaty of Limits, Alexander and Cleveland Awards, Statute of the Court (Articles 59 and 60).
- Previous judgments: 2015 Judgment of the ICJ in the case concerning the Land Boundary in the Northern Part of Isla Portillos.
- Legal concepts: Res judicata (issue preclusion), peripheral or subsidiary matters, obiter dicta.
- Parties' positions: Costa Rica focuses on the course of the land boundary in the northern part of Isla Portillos, while Nicaragua argues that its sovereignty over the beach is based on the 1858 Treaty of Limits and should not be considered res judicata.
- Disputed territory: The northern part of Isla Portillos, a wetland area of approximately 3 square kilometers between the San Juan River and the Caribbean Sea.
- Preliminary objections: Nicaragua's preliminary objections were not admitted by the Court.
- Judgment: The Court determined that Costa Rica has sovereignty over the disputed territory, as defined in the 2015 Judgment. However, due to a lack of information from the parties, the Court refrained from determining the land boundary more precisely. The issue of sovereignty over the stretch of coast abutting the Caribbean Sea was also addressed.
