Title: Application for Revision of the Judgment of 11 July 1996 in the Case concerning Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Bosnia and Herzegovina v. Yugoslavia), Preliminary Objections (Yugoslavia v. Bosnia and Herzegovina)

Case Overview:
This case involves an application for revision of a judgment rendered by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) on 11 July 1996. The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY) filed the application, alleging the discovery of new facts. The FRY argues that the admission of Yugoslavia as a member of the United Nations in 2000 constitutes a new fact that justifies the revision of the judgment. Bosnia and Herzegovina opposes the application, claiming that the alleged new facts do not meet the requirements for revision under Article 61 of the ICJ's Statute.

Important Details:
- The FRY filed an application for revision of the judgment based on the discovery of a new fact, namely its admission as a new member of the United Nations on 1 November 2000.
- The FRY argues that the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) had knowledge of the facts subsequent to the 1996 judgment, which were unknown to the ICJ at the time.
- The FRY seeks to draw legal consequences from these new facts, which it claims cannot be regarded as facts within the meaning of Article 61 of the ICJ's Statute.
- The Court will examine whether the FRY's application for revision meets the requirements of Article 61, including whether the facts were unknown to the Court and the parties at the time of the original judgment.
- The ICJ considered the admissibility of the FRY's application and requested the parties to present their views in writing on the matter.
- The judges involved in the case are Mr. Vladimir Djen, Mr. Andreas Zimmermann, Mr. Sakib Softi, Mr. Phon van den Biesen, and Mr. Alam Pellet.
