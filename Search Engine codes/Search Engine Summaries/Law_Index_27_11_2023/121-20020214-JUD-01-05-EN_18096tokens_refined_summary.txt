Title: Arrest Warrant of 11 April 2000 (Democratic Republic of the Congo v. Belgium)

Case Overview:
The case involves a dispute between the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and Belgium regarding the international arrest warrant issued against the acting Congolese Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr. Abdoulaye Yerodia Ndombasi. The DRC argues that Belgium cannot exercise universal jurisdiction over Mr. Ndombasi as he is not present in Belgium and the crimes were committed outside of Belgium's territory. Belgium, on the other hand, argues that it has a general obligation under customary international law to prosecute perpetrators of crimes, regardless of their nationality or location. The case raises questions about the universal jurisdiction of Belgian courts and the principle of nonintervention in the affairs of other states.

Important Details:
- The DRC filed an Application against Belgium over an international arrest warrant issued against Mr. Ndombasi for alleged crimes constituting "grave violations of international humanitarian law."
- The DRC argues that the arrest warrant violates its sovereignty and the principle of nonintervention.
- Belgium argues that it has a general obligation to prosecute perpetrators of crimes, regardless of their nationality or location.
- The DRC removed the request for the court to determine universal jurisdiction from its final submissions.

- The exercise of jurisdiction does not require territorial presence if the offense violates the fundamental interests of the international community.

- The "Lotus" case is an example of the exercise of universal jurisdiction, where the PCIJ held that a state may exercise jurisdiction over acts committed outside its territory if it can rely on a permissive rule of international law.
- The exercise of universal jurisdiction has evolved over time, and modern international law has developed a number of provisions that limit the exercise of universal jurisdiction.
- While universal jurisdiction remains a potential tool for the prosecution of international crimes, its exercise is subject to strict limitations and requirements.
- There is no general rule of positive international law giving states the right to punish foreign nationals for crimes against humanity, but there are clear indications of a significant principle of international law evolving in this area.

- The document mentions the Alien Tort Claims Act in the United States, which asserts jurisdiction over human rights violations and major violations of international law perpetrated by non-nationals overseas.
