Title: Whaling in the Antarctic (Australia v. Japan: New Zealand intervening)

Case Overview:
Australia initiated proceedings against Japan on May 31, 2010, alleging that Japan's large-scale whaling program in the Antarctic, known as JARPA II, violated its obligations under the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling (ICRW) and other international obligations for the preservation of marine mammals and the marine environment.

Important Details:

- Judge Owada disagrees with the Court's approach to New Zealand's intervention, believing that it fails to adequately address the serious issues raised by Japan.
- The Court held that New Zealand's intervention was admissible under Article 63, while Japan's objection to the intervention was not sustainable.
