Title: Whaling in the Antarctic (Australia v. Japan: New Zealand intervening)

Case Overview:
Australia initiated proceedings against Japan in May 2010, alleging that Japan's whaling program, JARPA II, violated its obligations under the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling (ICRW) and other international obligations for the preservation of marine mammals and the marine environment.

Document Overview:
This judgment, dated March 31, 2014, is from the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in Case Number 148. The judges involved in the case were President Abraham, Vice-President Donoghue, Judges Owada, Sebutinde, Abdallah, Gaja, and Bennouna. The document is a judgment and covers paragraphs 86-202.

Important Details:
- The ICJ analyzed Japan's whaling program, JARPA II, and raised concerns about its scientific basis and the size of the sample sizes.
- Discrepancies were found between the sample sizes of JARPA II and previous research programs, casting doubt on the program's objectives.
- The ICJ questioned the need for lethal methods and the lack of non-lethal methods in JARPA II.
- Japan failed to demonstrate a requirement to prioritize non-lethal methods.
- The case highlights the need for a clear definition of scientific research in the Convention and the potential conflicts between states' sovereign rights and regulatory objectives.
- Judge Bennouna dissented from the majority decision, arguing that the interpretation of the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling and its Schedule was flawed.
- Judge Bennouna emphasized the importance of considering the Convention's objectives, including the conservation and sustainable development of whale stocks.
- The Court cannot substitute itself for Convention bodies, and cooperation between states parties to the Convention is essential.

Additional Information:
- The judgment was delivered on March 31, 2016, after the case was heard on May 28, 2015.
- The ICJ refused to evaluate the evidence regarding whether JARPA II had attributes of commercial whaling.
- Judge Bennouna disagreed with the majority's decision, arguing that JARPA II should not be considered a commercial activity.
- The author suggests that the Court should have allowed the Commission and Scientific Committee to evaluate the program instead of substituting itself.
