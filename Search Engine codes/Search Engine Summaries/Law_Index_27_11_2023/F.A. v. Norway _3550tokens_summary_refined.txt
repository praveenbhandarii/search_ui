- Document Details: Decision on the admissibility of a communication submitted by F.A. alleging discrimination by a housing agency in Norway
- Document Dates: March 2000 (date of decision)

Case Summary:
The Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination decided on the admissibility of a communication submitted by F.A., who alleged discrimination by a housing agency in Norway. The State party challenged the admissibility, citing the failure to meet the six-month deadline set out in the rules of procedure. The Committee found the communication inadmissible and urged Norway to take effective measures to prevent discriminatory practices in the private housing sector.

Procedural History:
The author, F.A., a Norwegian citizen of Somali origin, alleged that the State party, Norway, violated their rights under the Convention by failing to investigate and prosecute a housing agency that discriminated against them based on their ethnic origin. The communication was transmitted to the State party on 13 September 2000. The author informed the Oslo police about the discriminatory practices of the housing agency and requested charges be brought against the owner on the basis of section 349a of the Norwegian Penal Code. The police took more than two years to investigate the case, and during that time, they never visited the housing agency in question to collect evidence. The owner of the agency was ordered to pay NKr 5,000 or alternatively to serve 10 days in prison for contravention of section 349a of the Penal Code.

Legal Analysis and Reasoning:
The Committee held that the State party's obligation to protect the author's rights under the Convention was violated due to the failure to investigate and prosecute the housing agency. The Committee found that the State party's actions were not sufficient to address the discriminatory practices and that the author was denied effective protection against discrimination.

Decisions and Rulings:
The Committee found that the communication was inadmissible due to the author's failure to submit the communication within the time limit set out in rule 91(f) of the Committee's rules of procedure. The Committee noted that there were no exceptional circumstances that would justify not applying the six-month requirement stipulated in rule 91(f) of the rules of procedure.

Impact and Significance:
The decision highlights the importance of meeting the time limits set out in the rules of procedure for submitting a communication to the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination. It also emphasizes the need for States to take effective measures to prevent discriminatory practices in the private sector, particularly in the context of housing. The Committee's recommendation that Norway give full effect to its obligations under article 5(e)(iii) of the Convention underscores the importance of protecting individuals from racial discrimination in the enjoyment of their human rights.
