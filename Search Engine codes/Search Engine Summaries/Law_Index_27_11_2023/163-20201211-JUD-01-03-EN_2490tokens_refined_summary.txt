Title: Immunities and Criminal Proceedings (Equatorial Guinea v. France)

Case Overview:
The Republic of Equatorial Guinea initiated proceedings against the French Republic regarding the immunity from criminal jurisdiction of the Second Vice-President of Equatorial Guinea, Mr. Teodoro Nguema Obiang Mangue, and the legal status of the Embassy of Equatorial Guinea in France.

Document Overview:
This judgment document from the International Court of Justice (ICJ) provides key information related to the case. It includes a declaration from a previous case (France v. Equatorial Guinea) dated 4 October 2011, delivered by Judge Gaja. Additionally, it references a note verbale dated 27 July 2012, sent by the French Ministry of Foreign and European Affairs to the French Ministry of Justice, regarding the assignment of a building in Paris as premises of the diplomatic mission of Equatorial Guinea. The judge(s) for the document are not specified.

Important Details:
- The Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations does not require the receiving State's consent for the sending State to use a building as premises of a diplomatic mission.
- Article 1(i) of the Convention confirms that the sending State can use a building without specifying the need for the receiving State's consent.
- Article 12 of the Convention supports the interpretation that no consent is required for using a building in the capital city where the mission is established.
- Article 21, paragraph 1 of the Convention states that the receiving State should facilitate the acquisition of necessary premises for the sending State's mission, but it does not explicitly require consent for building use.
- Objections by the receiving State after the acquisition of a building can cause inconvenience and financial loss to the sending State.
- The Convention does not support the idea that the receiving State has a say in the location of diplomatic premises based on respect for sovereignty.
- Diplomatic premises are inviolable but do not infringe on the territorial sovereignty of the receiving State.
- The receiving State's laws and regulations, including those related to town planning and zoning, apply to diplomatic premises.
- Some receiving States have enacted legislation or sent circular notes asserting the right to refuse consent for future choice of diplomatic premises, but this practice does not establish a customary rule or agreement.
- There is no evidence of France claiming that the location of diplomatic premises in Paris is conditional on the receiving State's consent, thus no agreement exists under international law.

Additional Information:
The document also addresses a subsidiary argument made by France regarding the assignment of the building for the purpose of criminal proceedings. The French Ministry of Foreign and European Affairs objected to the assignment, suggesting the need for consent from the receiving State.
