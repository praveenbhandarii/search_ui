Document Overview:
This judgment document, issued by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) on an unknown date in 2016, provides a summary of the case and its key elements. It includes information about the judges involved, the paragraphs referred to in the document, and a summary of the case's facts, legal issues, and key dates.

Important Details:
- Equatorial Guinea filed an application with the ICJ, seeking a declaration that France's criminal proceedings against Mr. Obiang Mangue are an abuse of process.
- France argues that Equatorial Guinea's application is an abusive use of diplomatic immunities and requests the ICJ to decline jurisdiction over the case.
- The ICJ must determine the admissibility of Equatorial Guinea's application and whether France's criminal proceedings against Mr. Obiang Mangue constitute an abuse of process.
- The case raises questions about the intersection of diplomatic immunities and criminal proceedings and the limitations on the ICJ's judicial function.
- Equatorial Guinea's application must be considered without compromising the ICJ's judicial integrity.
