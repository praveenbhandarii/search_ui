Case Summary:
A. S., a Russian citizen of Roma ethnicity, submitted a communication to the UNCRPD, alleging a violation by Russia of articles 4, 5, and 6 of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. The alleged victim claimed to be a victim of hate speech and incitement to hatred and discrimination, following the distribution of offensive leaflets in the town of Opochka, Pskov region. The UNCRPD held that the Russian authorities had failed to adequately protect the alleged victim and the Roma community from hate speech and incitement to hatred and discrimination, and recommended that Russia take appropriate measures to address the situation.

Procedural History:
The case was submitted to the UNCRPD by A. S., a Russian citizen of Roma ethnicity, alleging a violation by Russia of articles 4, 5, and 6 of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. The communication was found admissible by the UNCRPD under article 14, paragraph 7, of the Convention. The case was initially dismissed by the Pskov Regional Court, but the decision was overturned by the Committee on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination.

Legal Analysis and Reasoning:
The UNCRPD considered the allegations made by A. S. and examined the actions taken by the Russian authorities in response to the distribution of offensive leaflets. The Committee observed that the investigation had focused primarily on identifying the authors of the leaflets, rather than addressing the impact of their contents on the Roma community. The UNCRPD held that the Russian authorities had failed to adequately protect the alleged victim and the Roma community from hate speech and incitement to hatred and discrimination. The Committee emphasized the obligation of states parties to provide effective protection against hate speech and incitement to hatred and discrimination. The Committee also analyzed the relevant legal provisions, including Article 4 of the Convention, which prohibits hate speech and propaganda based on racial superiority or ethnic origin.

Decisions and Rulings:
The UNCRPD concluded that the Russian authorities had violated articles 4, 5, and 6 of the Convention by failing to adequately protect the alleged victim and the Roma community from hate speech and incitement to hatred and discrimination. The Committee recommended that Russia take appropriate measures to address the situation, including launching a new investigation into the incident and providing compensation to the alleged victim. The Committee also highlighted the need for the State party to criminalize hate speech and propaganda based on racial superiority or ethnic origin.

Impact and Significance:
The case highlights the importance of states' obligations to protect individuals and communities from hate speech and incitement to hatred and discrimination. It emphasizes the role of the UNCRPD in monitoring states' compliance with their obligations under the Convention and providing redress to victims of racial discrimination. The case also underscores the need for effective legal remedies and the enforcement of laws that criminalize hate speech and propaganda based on racial superiority or ethnic origin. The decision of the UNCRPD sets a precedent for future cases involving hate speech and discrimination.

Context Summary:
The case highlights the issue of racial discrimination against the Roma community in Russia. The distribution of racist leaflets in a predominantly Roma-populated area is seen as a manifestation of systemic racism and xenophobia in Russian society. The State party's argument that the intent of the leaflets was not to incite hatred between different ethnic groups, but rather to harm only two individuals, is seen as unconvincing by the Committee.

Legal Analysis:

The Committee's decision is based on its interpretation of Article 14, paragraph 1, of the Convention, which sets out the criteria for admissibility of communications. The Committee finds that the petitioner does not meet the criteria for admissibility since she is not directly and personally affected by the action in question. The Committee notes that the State party has an obligation under Articles 4 and 6 of the Convention to prosecute ex officio all statements and actions which attempt to justify or promote racial hatred and discrimination in any form.

Issues and Reasoning:

The main issue in the case is whether the petitioner has legal standing to bring a complaint before the Committee. The Committee finds that the petitioner does not have legal standing since she is not directly and personally affected by the action in question. The Committee also notes that the State party has failed to provide information on complaints or court decisions in civil or administrative, as well as criminal proceedings, concerning acts of racial discrimination.

Relevance and Implications:

The case highlights the importance of addressing systemic racism and xenophobia in Russian society, particularly against the Roma community. The Committee's decision underscores the need for the State party to take concrete steps to address hate speech and hate crimes against marginalized communities. The case also emphasizes the importance of ensuring that victims of racial discrimination have access to effective remedies and legal recourse.
