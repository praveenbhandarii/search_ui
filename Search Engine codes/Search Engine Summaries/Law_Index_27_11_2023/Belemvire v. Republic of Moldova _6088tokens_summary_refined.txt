Case Summary:
The petitioner, Mr. Belemvire, alleged that he was physically attacked by S.I. on November 14, 2013, and that the attack was racially motivated. He claimed that the respondent, the Republic of Moldova, violated his rights under article 5 (a) and (b) and 7 of the Convention, as well as article 6 of the Convention. The Committee found that the petitioner has failed to substantiate his allegations under article 14 (1) of the Convention, but has sufficiently substantiated his claims under article 6 of the Convention. The Committee concluded that the State party violated article 6 of the Convention by failing to investigate the discriminatory motive of the defendant and depriving the petitioner of his right to effective protection and remedies against the reported act of racial discrimination. The Committee recommended that the State party grant the petitioner adequate compensation and review its policy and procedures concerning the prosecution of cases of alleged racial discrimination or racially motivated violence.

Procedural History:
The case was brought before the United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination (CERD) under communication No. 71/2015. The petitioner, Mr. Belemvire, alleged that he was physically attacked by S.I. on November 14, 2013, and that the attack was racially motivated. The respondent, the Republic of Moldova, was notified of the communication and provided with an opportunity to respond. The Committee considered the communication and the State party's response in reaching its decision.

Legal Analysis and Reasoning:
The issue before the Committee was whether the State party fulfilled its obligation to provide effective protection and remedies against any acts of racial discrimination, as prescribed by article 6 of the Convention. The petitioner alleged that the respondent violated his rights under article 5 (a) and (b) and 7 of the Convention, as well as article 6 of the Convention. The Committee found that the petitioner has failed to substantiate his allegations under article 14 (1) of the Convention. However, the Committee found that the petitioner has sufficiently substantiated his claims under article 6 of the Convention. The State party investigated the incident, but treated it as an act of hooliganism and did not consider the discriminatory motive of the defendant. The State party's refusal to investigate the racial motive deprived the petitioner of his right to effective protection and remedies against the reported act of racial discrimination.

Decisions and Rulings:
The Committee concluded that the State party violated article 6 of the Convention by failing to investigate the discriminatory motive of the defendant and depriving the petitioner of his right to effective protection and remedies against the reported act of racial discrimination. The Committee recommended that the State party grant the petitioner adequate compensation for the material and moral injury caused by the violation of the Convention. The Committee also recommended that the State party review its policy and procedures concerning the prosecution of cases of alleged racial discrimination or racially motivated violence, in the light of its obligations under the Convention.

Impact and Significance:
The decision highlights the importance of effective protection and remedies against acts of racial discrimination, as prescribed by article 6 of the Convention. It emphasizes the need for States parties to ensure that their laws and policies are in line with their obligations under the Convention, and that they effectively protect individuals from racial discrimination. The decision sets a precedent for future cases involving racial discrimination and provides guidance for States parties on their obligations under the Convention.
