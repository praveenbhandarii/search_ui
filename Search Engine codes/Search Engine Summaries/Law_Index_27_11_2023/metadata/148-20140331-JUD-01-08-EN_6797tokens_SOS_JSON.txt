    "Case Summary": "This case involves Australia's challenge against Japan's large-scale whaling program, known as JARPA II, in the Antarctic. Australia argues that Japan's program violates its obligations under the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling (ICRW) and other international obligations for the preservation of marine mammals and the marine environment. The ICJ ruled that Japan's decision to grant special permits for JARPA II was not objectively reasonable and violated the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling. The importance of conservation for the protection of whale resources and the evolving restrictions on commercial whaling for conservation purposes was emphasized.",
