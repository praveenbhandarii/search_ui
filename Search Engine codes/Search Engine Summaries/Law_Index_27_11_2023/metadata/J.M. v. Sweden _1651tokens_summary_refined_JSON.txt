  "Document Date": "2022",
  "Document Summary": "The author, J.M., claimed that his removal to Afghanistan would breach his rights under the Convention due to his medical conditions and the risk of violence. The State party, Sweden, argued that parts of the communication were inadmissible and that the communication had been insufficiently substantiated. The Committee decided to register the communication and grant interim measures to prevent the author's removal to Afghanistan. The State party submitted that the decision to expel the author was due to become statute-barred. The author filed a new asylum application, and the State party requested that the Committee discontinue its consideration of the communication since the expulsion decision had become statute-barred and the author's asylum application remained pending.",
