    "Case Summary": "This case, numbered 124, involves a territorial and maritime dispute between the Republic of Nicaragua and the Republic of Colombia. Nicaragua filed an Application in 2001, initiating proceedings regarding a group of related legal issues concerning title to territory and maritime delimitation. The proceedings were suspended in 2003 due to Colombia's preliminary objections to jurisdiction. The document discusses the concept of 'an interest of a legal nature' in the context of intervention proceedings before the ICJ. It highlights the exception to the general rule that third-state intervention is not allowed and provides insights into the development of the ICJ's practice relating to maritime delimitation. The document also mentions the use of various legal instruments, including the ICJ's statute and the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS).",
