  "Case Summary": "The case involves a dispute between Malaysia and Singapore over the sovereignty of Pedra Branca/Pulau Batu Puteh, Middle Rocks, and South Ledge. The parties jointly approached the International Court of Justice (ICJ) to determine the ownership of these maritime features. The Court's judgment would be final and binding on both countries. Judges Simma and Abraham dissent from the majority opinion of the Court, arguing that sovereignty over Pedra Branca/Pulau Batu Puteh does not belong to Singapore. The dissenting judges disagree with the majority's interpretation of the facts and the law, particularly regarding the period before the construction of Horsburgh lighthouse on the island in 1844.",
