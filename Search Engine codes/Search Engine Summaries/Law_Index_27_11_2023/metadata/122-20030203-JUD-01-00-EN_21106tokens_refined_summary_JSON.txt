    "Case Summary": "This case involves an application for revision of a judgment rendered by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) on 11 July 1996. The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY) filed the application, alleging the discovery of new facts. The FRY argues that the admission of Yugoslavia as a member of the United Nations in 2000 constitutes a new fact that justifies the revision of the judgment. Bosnia and Herzegovina opposes the application, claiming that the alleged new facts do not meet the requirements for revision under Article 61 of the ICJ's Statute.",
