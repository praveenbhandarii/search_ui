  "Case Summary": "The case involves a territorial and maritime dispute between Nicaragua and Colombia. Nicaragua filed an application in 2001, and Colombia raised preliminary objections to jurisdiction in 2003, leading to the suspension of the proceedings on the merits. The International Court of Justice (ICJ) has the discretion to grant intervention in maritime boundary cases, and the Court's practice is based on the idea that a generalized interest in international law is not sufficient to comprise an interest of a legal nature.",
