  "Case Summary": "The case involves a Slovak citizen, Mr. Lacko, who was denied service at a restaurant because he is Roma. The restaurant owner has a history of discriminating against Roma people, and Mr. Lacko was only admitted to the restaurant on some days when he was considered 'polite.' The petitioner's lawyer claims that the restaurant owner's actions constitute racial discrimination and violate several articles of the European Convention on Human Rights. The State party argues that the petitioner failed to exhaust domestic remedies available to him, but the Committee found that there were no effective remedies available to the petitioner under Slovak law.",
