    "Document Summary": "This judgment, issued by the ICJ on March 20, 2018, dismisses Kenya's preliminary objection in the dispute with Somalia over their maritime boundary. The judgment is written by Judge Mohamed Bennouna. The MOU between the parties establishes a method of settlement for the dispute, but the ICJ finds it incompatible with the ordinary meaning of the treaty provision. Kenya's reservation to the declaration recognizing the jurisdiction of the Court is deemed valid as the MOU does not provide a different method of settlement from that specified in Article 83, paragraph 1, of UNCLOS.",
    "Case Summary": "This case involves a dispute between Somalia and Kenya regarding the delimitation of their maritime boundaries in the Indian Ocean. Somalia seeks the determination of the complete course of the single maritime boundary dividing the maritime areas of both countries, including the continental shelf beyond 200 nautical miles. The case involves the interpretation of an MOU between the parties, the jurisdiction of the ICJ, and the establishment of the complete course of the maritime boundary.",
