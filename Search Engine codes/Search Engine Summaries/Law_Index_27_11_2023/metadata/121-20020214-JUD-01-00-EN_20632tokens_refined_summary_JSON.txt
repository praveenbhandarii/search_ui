The DRC argues that the arrest warrant violates international law, including principles of state sovereignty, sovereign equality, and diplomatic immunity. Belgium objects to the jurisdiction and admissibility of the case. The arrest warrant is based on allegations of inciting racial hatred, resulting in several hundred deaths, internment, summary executions, arbitrary arrests, and unfair trials, which the DRC claims constitute grave violations of international humanitarian law.",
