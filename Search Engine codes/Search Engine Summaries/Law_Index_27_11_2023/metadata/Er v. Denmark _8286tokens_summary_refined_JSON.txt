    "Case Summary": "The case involves the complainant, Murat Er, alleging denial of a training position at a company due to his ethnic background. The State party, Denmark, argued the complaint is inadmissible, claiming no imminent violation of the complainant's rights under the Convention. The State party's analysis contended that the protection offered and remedies available fully satisfy the Convention's requirements. However, the Human Rights Committee concluded that the complainant's rights were violated, highlighting issues of racial discrimination and the need for effective protection and remedies. The decision by the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination further supports the finding of violations and emphasizes the importance of effective protection against ethnic discrimination and the interpretation of national legislation in accordance with international human rights conventions, recommending adequate compensation and wide publicity of its opinion among prosecutors and judicial bodies.",
