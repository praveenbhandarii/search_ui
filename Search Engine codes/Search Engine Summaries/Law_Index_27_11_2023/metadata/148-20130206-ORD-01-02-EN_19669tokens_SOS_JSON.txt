The document also references relevant dates, citations, and the file name. It further includes a separate opinion from Judge Antonio Augusto Canado Trindade.",
  "Case Summary": "Australia initiated proceedings against Japan in 2010, alleging that Japan's whaling program in the Antarctic, known as JARPA II, violated international obligations for the preservation of marine mammals and the marine environment. New Zealand intervened based on its status as a party to the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling (the Convention). The key legal issue is the legality of Japan's large-scale special permit whaling under the JARPA II program. The ICJ granted permission to New Zealand to intervene in the case, while dismissing applications from other countries. The case raises important questions about the protection of the environment and the rights of Polynesian, Melanesian, and Micronesian peoples.",
