Title: Territorial and Maritime Dispute (Nicaragua v. Colombia)

Case Overview:
This case, numbered 124, involves a territorial and maritime dispute between the Republic of Nicaragua and the Republic of Colombia. The dispute centers around issues of territory and maritime delimitation. The proceedings were initiated by Nicaragua on December 6, 2001, and Colombia filed preliminary objections to jurisdiction on July 21, 2003, leading to a suspension of the proceedings on the merits. Costa Rica has applied for permission to intervene in the case, claiming an interest of a legal nature in the Caribbean Sea area claimed by the parties. The ICJ has not yet made a decision on Costa Rica's application.

Important Details:
- Costa Rica has made a declaration under Article 36, paragraph 2, of the ICJ Statute and is a party to the Pact of Bogot.
- Nicaragua argues that Costa Rica has failed to identify the precise object of its intervention, while Colombia supports Costa Rica's intervention.
- The ICJ emphasizes that the intervention proceedings should focus on demonstrating the interest of a legal nature and not on substantive issues of the main proceedings.
- The ICJ has previously ruled that an interest of a legal nature does not require the same level of protection as an established right.
- The ICJ does not require a basis of jurisdiction between the parties and the State seeking to intervene as a nonparty.
- The ICJ has decided that Costa Rica has a legal interest in at least some areas claimed by the parties to the main proceedings and going beyond those lines.
- The ICJ has clarified that the exact geographical parameters of Costa Rica's legal interest may not be necessary to examine.
- The decision on Costa Rica's application for permission to intervene has been reserved.

Document Details:
This judgment document, titled "Binding Judgment" and with file number "CIJ1019.indb," pertains to the territorial and maritime dispute (Nicaragua v. Colombia) case. The document provides information about the case number, judges (including Vice President Abdulqawi Ahmed Yusuf and Judge ad hoc Rudolf Bernhardt), legal framework, citations, and the parties involved. It also mentions the request for permission to intervene submitted by Costa Rica, citing Article 62 of the ICJ Statute and Article 81 of the Rules of Court. The ICJ has considered Costa Rica's application and has found that it does not have an interest of a legal nature that may be affected by the decision in the main proceedings. The ICJ has therefore denied Costa Rica's application for permission to intervene in the proceedings. The judgment was issued on May 4, 2011, and was signed by the President of the ICJ, Hisashi Owada, and the Registrar, Philippe Couvreur. Dissenting opinions were appended by Judges Al-Khasawneh and Abraham.

Additional Information:
The case is ongoing, and the ICJ has held hearings and received written observations from the parties regarding Costa Rica's application for intervention. The ICJ will decide whether to permit Costa Rica's intervention based on the criteria set out in the Statute and Rules of Court. The ICJ has clarified that the intervention proceedings should focus on the interest of a legal nature and not on substantive issues of the main proceedings. The existence of a valid link of jurisdiction between the intervener and the parties is not a requirement for a successful intervention application, unless the intervener intends to become a party to the case. The judgment clarifies the legal basis for maritime boundaries in the Caribbean and establishes a precedent for future disputes of this nature.
