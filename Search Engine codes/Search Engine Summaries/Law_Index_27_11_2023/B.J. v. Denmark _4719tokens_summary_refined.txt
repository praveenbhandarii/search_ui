Case Summary:
The author, who is of African descent, was denied admission to a discotheque in Odense, Denmark, because of his ethnic background. He filed a complaint with the police, which was rejected, and then appealed to the State Attorney, who initiated an investigation. The Public Prosecutor brought the case before the District Court of Odense, which ruled that the doorman was to be fined DKK 1,000 for violation of section 1, subparagraph 2, of Consolidated Act No. 626 of 29 September 1987 on racial discrimination. The author had also requested the Public Prosecutor to file a claim for compensation, but the court rejected it. The author did not receive a copy of the court's judgment until after the time limit for filing an appeal had expired. The High Court did not find any basis for a claim of compensation, stating that the doorman's actions did not involve sufficient severity or humiliation to justify compensation under section 26 of the Act on Civil Liability. The author's counsel argued that the case involved issues of principle and applied to the Procesbevillingsnaevn for a special permit to appeal to the Supreme Court, but the application was rejected. Under Danish law, no further remedies are available.

Legal Analysis:
The Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination considered the author's communication and found that the State party had violated article 6 of the Convention by failing to provide adequate reparation or satisfaction to the author for the non-pecuniary damage he had suffered. The Committee noted that the State party's argument that the author's claim for compensation should be rejected because the damage to his self-esteem had not been sufficiently grave or humiliating was not in line with the Convention's requirements. The Committee emphasized that victims of racial discrimination have a right to seek just and adequate reparation or satisfaction, including economic compensation, and that the State party must take measures to ensure that such reparation or satisfaction is provided. The Committee recommended that the State party review its legislation and practices to ensure that they are in compliance with the Convention's provisions regarding reparation and satisfaction for victims of racial discrimination.

Procedural History:
- The author filed a complaint with the police, which was rejected.

Legal Analysis and Reasoning:
- The author claimed that he was denied admission to a discotheque because of his ethnic background, which constitutes an act of racial discrimination.
- The State party argued that the author's claim for compensation for non-pecuniary damage should be rejected, as the damage to the author's self-esteem had not been sufficiently grave or humiliating to warrant any compensation.
- The Committee found that the decision of the Eastern High Court refusing compensation to the author for non-pecuniary damage was based on a specific assessment of the circumstances concerning the criminal act.
- The Committee considered that the victim's claim for compensation has to be considered in every case, including those cases where no bodily harm has been inflicted but where the victim has suffered humiliation, defamation, or other attacks against his/her reputation and self-esteem.

Decisions and Rulings:
- The Committee found that the State party had violated article 6 of the Convention by failing to provide adequate reparation or satisfaction to the author for the non-pecuniary damage he had suffered.
- The Committee recommended that the State party take the measures necessary to ensure that the victims of racial discrimination seeking just and adequate reparation or satisfaction in accordance with article 6 of the Convention, including economic compensation, are provided with such reparation or satisfaction.
