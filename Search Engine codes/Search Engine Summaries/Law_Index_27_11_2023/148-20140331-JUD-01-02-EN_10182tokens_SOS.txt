Title: Whaling in the Antarctic (Australia v. Japan: New Zealand intervening)

Case Overview:
This case involves Australia's claim against Japan regarding Japan's large-scale whaling program in the Antarctic, known as JARPA II. Australia argues that Japan's whaling activities violate its obligations under the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling (ICRW) and other international obligations for the preservation of marine mammals and the marine environment.

Document Overview:
This document is a judgment type document from the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in Case Number 148. It was issued on March 31, 2014. The document provides important details and findings related to the dispute between Australia and Japan. The document includes the court's assessment of the research purposes of Japan's whaling program, the court's approach in evaluating the evidence presented, and the court's treatment of the respondent.

Important Details:
- Australia instituted proceedings against Japan in 2010, alleging that Japan's whaling program under JARPA II breached its obligations under the ICRW and other international obligations.
- Japan relied on a reservation to the ICJ's jurisdiction, arguing that the dispute fell within the scope of its reservation.
- The ICJ held that there were no overlapping claims by Australia and Japan in the maritime areas covered by the whaling program, and therefore the reservation did not apply.
- The ICJ also stated that the nature and extent of the maritime zones were immaterial to the dispute, and it was not necessary to determine which state had sovereign rights over the areas.
- The majority of the ICJ rejected Australia's claims and held that Japan's special whaling permits were for scientific research purposes under Article VIII of the 1946 Convention.
- Judges Abraham and Simma dissented, arguing that the ICJ should have based its decision solely on the second ground of Australia's reservation and that the majority's interpretation of Article VIII was too restrictive.
- Professor Walle stated that the sample sizes set for the research were reasonable, with the exception of fin whales.
- The court acknowledges that it cannot simply accept the truth of everything Professor Walle said, but his testimony should have carried substantial weight in its assessment of the true nature of JARPA II.
- The court emphasizes that it should have confined itself to answering the question of whether the activities concerned were conducted for purposes of scientific research, regardless of whether they were well-designed or poorly designed.
- The court notes that it did not apply an underlying negative preconception in its treatment of the respondent.

Additional Information:
- The ICJ's judgment in May 2015 emphasized the demandingness towards Japan and the need for Japan to demonstrate a reasonable basis for its annual sample sizes for whales.
- The ICJ adopted an objective approach in determining whether Japan's whaling program was for scientific research purposes.
- The judgment criticized Japan's methods and concluded that its program was not conducted for scientific research.
- The ICJ rejected Australia's request for a finding that Japan failed to comply with its obligations under the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling.
- The judgment highlighted the importance of presumption of good faith and solid evidence in such cases.

Overall, this case involves a dispute between Australia and Japan over Japan's whaling program in the Antarctic. The ICJ rejected Australia's claims and held that Japan's whaling permits were for scientific research purposes. However, there were dissenting opinions on the interpretation of the reservation and Article VIII of the Convention. The judgment emphasized the need for Japan to provide solid evidence and demonstrate a reasonable basis for its whaling activities. The court also considered the testimony of Professor Walle in assessing the true nature of JARPA II and emphasized the importance of an objective approach in evaluating the research purposes.
