Title: Sovereignty over Pedra Branca/Pulau Batu Puteh, Middle Rocks and South Ledge (Malaysia/Singapore)

Case Overview:
The case involves a territorial dispute between Malaysia and Singapore over the ownership of three islands: Pedra Branca/Pulau Batu Puteh, Middle Rocks, and South Ledge. The dispute was brought before the International Court of Justice (ICJ) through a Special Agreement signed by both parties. The Court was requested to determine the sovereignty over the islands, and both countries agreed to accept the Court's judgment as final and binding.

Important Details:
- The ICJ decided the case based on the principle of intertemporal law, giving effect to past treaties even if they do not reflect current international law.
- The Court recognized the special structure of the Sultanate of Johor and its authority over the Orang Laut, which confirmed the ancient original title of the Sultanate to the islands.
- The case highlights the ambiguity between colonial law and contemporary law in considering the structure of non-European states during the colonial period.
- The ICJ considered historical treaties such as the Treaty of Westphalia, the Crawfurd Treaty, and the Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1824, which influenced the region's territorial boundaries.
- The Court found that the Sultanate of Johor had a historic title to the islands, but this title was not recognized by the European Powers.
- Singapore's conduct over a significant period was decisive in determining its sovereignty over the islands.
- Great Britain's actions on Pedra Branca were driven by its own interests and rivalries between European Powers, rather than based on a title of sovereignty.
- The ICJ rejected the argument that South Ledge, a low-tide elevation, could not be subject to autonomous appropriation.
- Critical dates for determining sovereignty were February 14, 1980, and February 6, 1993, for Pedra Branca and Middle Rocks, and South Ledge, respectively.
- The ICJ's judgment was based on uti possidetis juris, avoiding entanglement in colonial history.
