Procedural History:
The case was brought before the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination (CERD) as a communication under the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. The Committee reviewed the communication and issued an opinion on the alleged violations.

Legal Analysis and Reasoning:
The case raises important issues related to hate speech and the obligation of States parties to take effective action to address such incidents. The petitioner argues that the respondent's failure to investigate the incident and its subsequent denial of his right to appeal constitute a violation of the Convention. The State party, on the other hand, argues that the petitioner has failed to exhaust domestic remedies and that the institution of proceedings under the Criminal Code could be regarded as an effective remedy.

Decisions and Rulings:
The Committee found that the State party had violated the petitioner's rights under the Convention. The Committee concluded that the State party had failed to conduct a proper investigation and had not taken effective action against the perpetrator of the hate speech.

Impact and Significance:
This case has implications for the protection of individuals from hate speech and the obligation of States parties to investigate and address allegations of racial discrimination. The decision reinforces the importance of effective investigations and the role of the Committee in addressing such cases. The case may serve as a precedent for future cases related to racial discrimination and hate speech.
