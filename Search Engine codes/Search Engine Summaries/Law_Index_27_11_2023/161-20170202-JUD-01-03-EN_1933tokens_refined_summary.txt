Title: Maritime Delimitation in the Indian Ocean (Somalia v. Kenya)

Case Overview:
This case, numbered 161, involves a dispute between Somalia and Kenya regarding the delimitation of maritime spaces in the Indian Ocean. Somalia filed an Application in 2014, seeking the International Court of Justice's determination of the maritime boundary between the two states based on international law.

Important Details:
- The dispute centers around the delimitation of the maritime boundary between Kenya and Somalia.
- Kenya made a reservation under Article 36(2) of the ICJ Statute, which pertains to compulsory jurisdiction.
- Somalia filed an application with the ICJ, but Kenya objected to its admissibility.
- The parties have a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) that provides for negotiations on maritime delimitation, but no agreement has been reached.
- The MOU stipulates that an application to the ICJ is inadmissible until the parties receive recommendations from the CLCS (Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf) regarding the outer continental shelf.
- Despite the MOU's timeline, the parties agreed to start negotiations in 2014 without any reservation or qualification, effectively setting aside the MOU.
