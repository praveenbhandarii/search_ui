Case Summary:
The author, a Pakistani national, alleges that he and his brother were subjected to racial discrimination by Mr. O.T. and Mr. K.P., who are Danish nationals, at Avedore High School in Denmark on 22 June 1998. The author claims that Mr. O.T. and Mr. K.P. used racist expressions against him and his brother, calling them "a bunch of monkeys" and stating that they could not express themselves correctly. The author's counsel requested the police to bring the case before the State Attorney, but this was denied. The High Court of the Eastern Circuit held that an incident of racial discrimination does not in itself imply a violation of the honour and reputation of a person under section 26 of the Danish Act on Tort. The author's counsel claims that the national authorities did not examine the case properly and that the author never obtained an apology or sufficient satisfaction or reparation.

Procedural History:
The author submitted a communication to the UN CERD, alleging racial discrimination by Denmark. The State party contended that the author failed to establish a prima facie case for admissibility. The Committee considered the communication and found that the author had established a prima facie case. The Committee requested the State party to provide the author with effective and adequate remedy, including compensation, and to take measures to prevent similar violations in the future.

Legal Analysis and Reasoning:
The UN CERD considered the author's communication and found that the author had established a prima facie case for the purpose of admissibility. The Committee noted that the author and his brother were subjected to racial discrimination by Mr. O.T. and Mr. K.P., who used racist expressions against them. The Committee also noted that the national authorities did not examine the case properly and that the author never obtained an apology or sufficient satisfaction or reparation. The Committee found that the statements made in the case fell within the ambit of section 266b of the Danish Criminal Code, which relates to insulting or degrading statements. The Committee reasoned that the author had been denied effective protection against racial discrimination and remedies attendant thereupon by the State party, in violation of article 6 of the ICCPR.

Decisions and Rulings:
The UN CERD found that the State party had violated the author's rights under the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. The Committee requested the State party to provide the author with effective and adequate remedy, including compensation, and to take measures to prevent similar violations in the future.

Impact and Significance:
The case highlights the importance of protecting individuals from racial discrimination in education institutions. It emphasizes the need for States to properly examine cases of racial discrimination and provide victims with effective and adequate remedies. The decision also emphasizes the role of the police and public prosecutors in ensuring that such investigations are conducted properly and that those responsible for racial discrimination are held accountable.
