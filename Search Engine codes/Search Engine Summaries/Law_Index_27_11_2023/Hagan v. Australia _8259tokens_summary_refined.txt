Case Summary:
The petitioner, Stephen Hagan, alleges that the use of the offensive term "Nigger Brown" on a grandstand at a sporting ground in Toowoomba, Queensland, violates articles 2, 4, 5, 6, and 7 of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. Australia argues that the term is not racially offensive and does not violate Article 4. The Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination finds that the use of the term is offensive and constitutes a violation of Article 4.

Procedural History:
The case was brought before the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination by Stephen Hagan against Australia. The petitioner alleged that the use of the term "Nigger" in the context of a sports ground name in Australia was racially offensive and violated Article 4 of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. The State party disputed the admissibility and merits of the petition. The Committee has jurisdiction to consider the petitioner's claim under Article 14 of the Convention.

Legal Analysis and Reasoning:
The Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination finds that the use of the term "Nigger Brown" is offensive and constitutes a violation of Article 4 of the Convention, which prohibits racial discrimination. The Committee rejects the state party's argument that the use of the term is not racially offensive and does not violate Article 4. The Committee also rejects the state party's contention that the petitioner's subjective feeling of offense does not constitute a violation of Article 4. The decision in this case has implications for similar cases where racially offensive terms are used, and serves as a reminder that the Convention must be interpreted and applied taking into account the circumstances of contemporary society.

Decisions and Rulings:
The Committee orders the state party, Australia, to take appropriate measures to eliminate the offensive term and prevent similar instances of racial discrimination in the future.

Impact and Significance:
The case highlights the importance of addressing racial discrimination in all forms, including the use of offensive language or symbols. The decision reinforces the obligation of State parties to amend laws that perpetuate racial discrimination and to take steps to prevent and combat racial discrimination. The decision also has implications for similar cases where racially offensive terms are used, and serves as a reminder that the Convention must be interpreted and applied taking into account the circumstances of contemporary society.
