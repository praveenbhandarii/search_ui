Case Summary:
The case involves S.M., a human rights activist, who alleges that Denmark violated his rights under the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.

He argues that Denmark's legislation allows for the punishment of offenders with formal criminal sanctions instead of social control sanctions, which is the reason for his opposition to forced medical treatment.
