Title: Immunities and Criminal Proceedings (Equatorial Guinea v. France)

Case Overview:
The case involves a dispute between the Republic of Equatorial Guinea and the French Republic regarding the immunity from criminal jurisdiction of the Second Vice-President of Equatorial Guinea and the legal status of the Embassy building in France. The proceedings were initiated on 13 June 2016.

Document Overview:
This judgment document from the International Court of Justice (ICJ) discusses the interpretation and application of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations (VCDR) regarding the status of premises of the mission. It also includes separate opinions, such as that of President Yusuf, who disagrees with the court's decision on the status of the building.

Important Details:
- The court erred in requiring prior approval or lack of objection by the receiving state for a property to be considered premises of the mission under the VCDR.
- The court ignored the criterion of use in determining the status of the building as premises of the mission.
- The judgment failed to offer a meaningful interpretation of the term "buildings...used for the purposes of the mission" in the VCDR.
- President Yusuf voted against subparagraph (1) of paragraph 126 of the judgment.
- The case involves the interpretation of Article 1(i) of the VCDR and the legal status of the Embassy building.
- The judgment's conclusion that the building never acquired the status of premises of the mission is illogical and unsupported by the VCDR.
- The author argues that the judgment misinterpreted the requirement of use and ignored the customary law of diplomatic relations.
- The author emphasizes that the essential functions of the mission must be carried out in a building, regardless of ownership.

Additional Information:
- The document also mentions other cases and legal principles related to diplomatic immunities, continental shelf delimitation, and maritime law.
- The judgment criticizes the transposition of a requirement for prior approval to international law, noting that France does not have such legislation or diplomatic practice.
- The VCDR does not require prior approval by the receiving state for the designation of premises by sending states.
- The judgment acknowledges that the practice of a few states cannot establish the agreement of the parties within the meaning of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties.
- The document provides details of a separate opinion by President Yusuf, discussing the power of the receiving State to object to the designation of a building as the premises of a diplomatic mission.
- The opinion argues against the transposition of a requirement for prior approval to international law and highlights the discretionary nature of the power to object.
- The opinion emphasizes that the need for such authorizations and complications for foreign missions does not exist in international law or the domestic legislation of the majority of UN Member States.
- The opinion also discusses the adverse effects of the power to object on the functioning of diplomatic missions and the promotion of friendly relations among states.
