Title: Territorial and Maritime Dispute (Nicaragua v. Colombia)

Case Overview:
The case involves a territorial and maritime dispute between Nicaragua and Colombia. Honduras also has an interest in the matter. The International Court of Justice (ICJ) is considering the interpretation of the 1986 Treaty between Nicaragua and Colombia and the role of Honduras in the dispute. The ICJ has not yet delivered a judgment.

Important Details:
- On 6 December 2001, Nicaragua filed an Application against Colombia regarding a dispute concerning territory and maritime delimitation.
- Nicaragua filed its Memorial on 28 April 2003, but Colombia filed preliminary objections to jurisdiction, leading to the suspension of proceedings on the merits.
- Judge Abraham disagrees with the Court's decision to reject Honduras' request to intervene in the case.
- He argues that third states have a conditional right to intervene, subject to certain conditions.
- The English version of Article 62 of the ICJ Statute is clearer than the French version regarding the essential condition for intervention.
- The Court has a discretionary power to decide whether or not to allow intervention, based on the State's interest of a legal nature and compatibility with the sound administration of justice.
- Previous ICJ judgments and the ICJ Statute support the right of a third state to intervene if certain conditions are met.
- The Court's power to decide on intervention is not discretionary, and a third state has a right to intervene if the conditions are satisfied.
- The case is related to the dispute between Nicaragua and Honduras, where the ICJ established a bisector line to delimit the maritime boundary in 2007.
- The future judgment may affect Honduras' interests in fixing the endpoint of the bisector line and its rights in the area to the south of the red line.
- The document includes a dissenting opinion by Judge Abraham, who argues that Honduras does have an interest that may be affected by the future judgment.
