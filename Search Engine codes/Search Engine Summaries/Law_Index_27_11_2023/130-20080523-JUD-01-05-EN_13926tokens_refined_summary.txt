Title: Sovereignty over Pedra Branca/Pulau Batu Puteh, Middle Rocks and South Ledge (Malaysia/Singapore)

Case Overview:
This case involves a dispute between Malaysia and Singapore over the sovereignty of Pedra Branca/Pulau Batu Puteh, Middle Rocks, and South Ledge. The International Court of Justice (ICJ) delivered a judgment in 2008, determining that Malaysia has original title to Pedra Branca/Pulau Batu Puteh, and that Middle Rocks and South Ledge fall within Malaysia's sovereignty.

Important Details:
- Malaysia retains ownership of Pedra Branca/Pulau Batu Puteh.
- The construction of Horsburgh lighthouse did not affect the sovereignty situation.
- The 1953 correspondence between Singapore and Johor was of uncertain meaning and authorization, and its significance was questioned.
- Singapore's failure to publicize the correspondence confirmed its inconsequential nature.
- The court found that the passing of sovereignty from Malaysia to Singapore was not justified by accepted principles governing territorial title acquisition.
- Singapore did not acquire territory, and the title to Pedra Branca/Pulau Batu Puteh remains with Malaysia.
- Middle Rocks and South Ledge fall within Malaysia's sovereignty.
- The court did not attach significance to Malaysia's 1969 legislation on its territorial sea or its agreements with Indonesia over their continental shelf and territorial seas.
- The court's handling of the maps depicting Pedra Branca/Pulau Batu Puteh was considered highly unsatisfactory, with the court attaching considerable significance to six Malaysian maps that appear to describe Pedra Branca/Pulau Batu Puteh as Singaporean territory.
