Title: Arrest Warrant of 11 April 2000 (Democratic Republic of the Congo v. Belgium)

Case Overview:
The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) filed a case against Belgium regarding an international arrest warrant issued against the acting Congolese Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr. Abdoulaye Yerodia Ndombasi. The DRC claimed that the warrant, issued for alleged crimes constituting "grave violations of international humanitarian law," violated international law. The arrest warrant was transmitted to all states, including the DRC.

Important Details:
- The immunities of foreign ministers are not clearly established in international law, unlike the immunities of diplomatic representatives.
- The Convention on Special Missions covers the immunities of foreign ministers but does not provide clear guidelines on the extent of their immunities.
- Foreign ministers cannot be assimilated to heads of state as they do not personify the state.
- The absence of precedents regarding the immunities of foreign ministers from criminal process adds to the confusion.
- A minister for foreign affairs accused of criminal conduct may not be prosecuted in his home state, distinguishing them from diplomatic representatives.
- The distinction between procedural and substantive aspects of immunity is relevant in this context.
- The immunities of foreign ministers cannot be assimilated to diplomatic immunities.
- A minister for foreign affairs is entitled to immunity from enforcement when on an official mission, but criminal investigations against him do not constitute interference with diplomacy.
- Belgium did not breach its obligations to the DRC by issuing the arrest warrant, as it contained language stating it was not to be enforced if Mr. Yerodia was on Belgian territory on an official mission.
- The issue of high state officials being entitled to immunity for exceptionally grave crimes raises questions about whether immunity should become de facto impunity.
- The judgment postulated four cases where a minister could be held personally accountable for prosecution in his/her home state, regardless of immunity.
- The document references international law and the draft Code of Crimes against the Peace and Security of Mankind.
- The dissenting view argues that personal accountability represents a higher norm than immunity rules.
