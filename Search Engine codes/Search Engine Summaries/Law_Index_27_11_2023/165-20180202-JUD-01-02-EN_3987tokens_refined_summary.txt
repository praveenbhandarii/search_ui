Title: Land Boundary in the Northern Part of Isla Portillos (Costa Rica v. Nicaragua)

Case Overview:
This case involves a dispute between Costa Rica and Nicaragua regarding the precise definition of the land boundary in the area of Los Portillos/Harbor Head Lagoon and the establishment of a new military camp by Nicaragua on the beach of Isla Portillos. Costa Rica filed an Application instituting proceedings against Nicaragua on 16 January 2017.

Important Details:
- The Court appointed two experts to determine the starting point of the land boundary between Costa Rica and Nicaragua in the Caribbean Sea and advise on the state of the coast between the two countries.
- The experts located the original starting point of the land boundary, now submerged under the sea, and marked the geographical coordinates of the land point that most closely approximates to the starting point identified by the first Alexander Award.
- The Court's interpretation of the 1858 Treaty in its 2015 Judgment is questionable.
- The issue of the starting point of the land boundary did not fall within the scope of the jurisdiction of the Court in that case.
- The coastline change of the San Juan River affects the determination of the land boundary.
- The Court has excluded the question of sovereignty over the coast of the northern part of Isla Portillos from its jurisdiction.
- The experts have reported that there is no longer any water channel connecting the San Juan River with Harbor Head Lagoon, and therefore the coast of the northern part of Isla Portillos belongs to Costa Rica.
- The Court has determined that Harbor Head Lagoon and the sandbar separating it from the Caribbean Sea are under Nicaragua's sovereignty.
- The Parties have recognized that the line around Harbor Head Lagoon still constitutes part of the land.
