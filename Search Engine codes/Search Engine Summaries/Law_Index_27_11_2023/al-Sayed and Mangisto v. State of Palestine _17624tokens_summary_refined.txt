Case Summary:
The case involves communications submitted by Shaaban al-Sayed and Gashao Mangisto, fathers of two missing Israeli civilians with psychosocial disabilities, alleging violations of their rights under the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. The alleged victims disappeared after entering the Gaza Strip and have not been seen since.

Procedural History:
The communications were submitted to the United Nations Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities under the Optional Protocol. The Committee requested the State of Palestine to take immediate measures to search for the alleged victims, ensure their protection under the law, and provide them with necessary care and attention.

Legal Analysis and Reasoning:
The authors claimed that they were subjected to torture and ill-treatment during their detention. The State party failed to provide an effective remedy for the alleged violations and did not conduct a prompt, effective, thorough, impartial, independent, and transparent investigation into the circumstances of the disappearance and detention. The Committee found that the State party had violated articles 10, 14, 15, and 25 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and article 4 of the Optional Protocol to the ICCPR. The Committee held that the State party's failure to provide an effective remedy and to conduct a proper investigation constituted a violation of the authors' rights under the ICCPR. The Committee also found that the State party's treatment of the authors during their detention amounted to a violation of their rights under article 10 of the ICCPR.

Decisions and Rulings:
The Committee adopted the communications at its 28th session and found that the State of Palestine violated the authors' rights under the Convention. The Committee requested the State of Palestine to provide information on the measures taken to implement its requests and the results of those measures. The Committee also recommended that the State of Palestine provide an effective remedy, including compensation for legal costs incurred by the authors.

Impact and Significance:
This decision by the United Nations Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities highlights the importance of States' obligations under international human rights law to protect individuals from human rights abuses and to provide effective remedies for alleged violations. The decision also underscores the importance of ensuring that individuals have access to medical care and contact with their families and representatives, particularly in cases of disappearance and arbitrary detention.
