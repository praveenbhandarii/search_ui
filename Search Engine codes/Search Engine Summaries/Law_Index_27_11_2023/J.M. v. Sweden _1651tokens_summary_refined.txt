Case Details:
- Case ID: 53/2018
- Court/Tribunal: United Nations Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities
- Document Dates: March 2022
- Key Parties Involved: J.M. (the author and victim), Sweden (the state party)
- Case Name: J.M. v. Sweden

Procedural History:
The author, J.M., a national of Afghanistan, claimed that his removal to Afghanistan would breach his rights under articles 10, 15, 16, 25, 26, and 27 of the Convention due to his medical conditions and the risk of violence. The State party, Sweden, argued that parts of the communication were inadmissible ratione materiae and ratione loci, and that the communication had been insufficiently substantiated. The Committee, acting through its Special Rapporteur on Communications under the Optional Protocol, decided to register the communication and grant interim measures to prevent the author's removal to Afghanistan. The State party submitted that the decision to expel the author was due to become statute-barred on 7 July 2021. The author filed a new asylum application, and the State party requested that the Committee discontinue its consideration of the communication since the expulsion decision had become statute-barred and the author's asylum application remained pending.

Legal Analysis and Reasoning:
The decision to discontinue the consideration of the case was based on the fact that the author no longer risked expulsion to Afghanistan, and therefore, the subject matter of the communication had become moot. The State party argued that parts of the communication were inadmissible ratione materiae and ratione loci and owing to non-exhaustion of domestic remedies. The State party further submitted that the communication had been insufficiently substantiated and that it was without merit.

Decisions and Rulings:
The Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities considered the communication and decided to discontinue the consideration of the case, as the subject matter had become moot due to the author no longer risking expulsion to Afghanistan.

Impact and Significance:
The decision highlights the importance of considering the potential risks faced by individuals with disabilities when evaluating their asylum claims. It also underscores the importance of ensuring that individuals with disabilities have access to appropriate medical care and treatment.
