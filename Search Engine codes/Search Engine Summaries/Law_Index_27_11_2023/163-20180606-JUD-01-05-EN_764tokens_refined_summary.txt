Case Overview:
This case, numbered 163, involves a dispute between the Republic of Equatorial Guinea and the French Republic. Equatorial Guinea initiated proceedings against France regarding the immunity from criminal jurisdiction of its Second Vice-President, Mr. Teodoro Nguema Obiang Mangue, and the legal status of the building housing Equatorial Guinea's embassy in France.

Document Overview:
This judgment document, dated 20180606, is a declaration by Judge Gaja regarding the ownership of a building located at 42 Avenue Foch in Paris. It pertains to the dispute between Equatorial Guinea and France concerning the use of the building as the premises of Equatorial Guinea's diplomatic mission. The document is written in English and is part of the International Court of Justice's judgment type documents.

Important Details:
- The dispute revolves around France's refusal to recognize the building at 42 Avenue Foch as the property of Equatorial Guinea.
- The court's jurisdiction, as per the Optional Protocol to the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, covers the use of the building as the premises of the diplomatic mission.
- The judgment does not explicitly state that the issue of ownership of the building falls outside the scope of the Optional Protocol.
- According to Article 1(i) of the Vienna Convention, the premises of a diplomatic mission include buildings and land used for mission purposes, regardless of ownership.
- Ownership of diplomatic mission premises is regulated by the municipal law of the host state, and the sending state does not necessarily own the premises.
- The Vienna Convention grants immunity to the premises, furnishings, and property of a diplomatic mission, but this immunity does not confer absolute protection to the building.
- The receiving state is not obligated to allow the sending state to continue using a specific building for its mission, and changes in ownership may lead to the termination of its use.
- The issue of ownership of the building at 42 Avenue Foch is distinct from the issue of inviolability and immunity of the mission premises covered by the Optional Protocol.
- The court lacks jurisdiction to decide on the ownership dispute, as it falls outside the scope of the Optional Protocol.
