Title: Sovereignty over Pedra Branca/Pulau Batu Puteh, Middle Rocks and South Ledge (Malaysia/Singapore)

Case Overview:
The case involves a dispute between Malaysia and Singapore over the sovereignty of Pedra Branca/Pulau Batu Puteh, Middle Rocks, and South Ledge. The parties jointly submitted the dispute to the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in 2003, requesting the court to determine the ownership of these territories. Both countries agreed to accept the court's judgment as final and binding.

- The historical context reveals that the Sultan of Johor had previously ceded the island to the British, who exercised colonial authority over it.
