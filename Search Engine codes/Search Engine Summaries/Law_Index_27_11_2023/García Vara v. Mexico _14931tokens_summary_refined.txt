- The State party's arguments regarding the person's failure to pass the entrance examinations and the requirements of the Bachelor of Visual Arts program were not sufficient to justify the lack of reasonable accommodation.

Decisions and Rulings:

- The Committee ordered Mexico to provide the author with access to inclusive tertiary education and to make reasonable accommodations to ensure her equal participation in and completion of her education.
- The Committee recommended that the State party provide the author with an effective remedy, including reimbursement of legal costs and appropriate compensation for the harm suffered, and ensure her right to tertiary education by making the admission process accessible and providing reasonable accommodations.
