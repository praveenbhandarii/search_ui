Title: Territorial and Maritime Dispute (Nicaragua v. Colombia)

Case Overview:
The case (Number 124) before the International Court of Justice involves a territorial and maritime dispute between Nicaragua and Colombia. Nicaragua filed an Application in 2001, seeking resolution of a group of related legal issues concerning title to territory and maritime delimitation. Colombia filed preliminary objections to jurisdiction in 2003, leading to the suspension of proceedings on the merits.

Important Details:
- Nicaragua claims sovereignty over the islands of San Andrés, Providencia, and Santa Catalina, which is disputed by Colombia.
- Judge Gaja agrees with the operative part of the judgment but disagrees with the view that there is no extant dispute between the parties regarding sovereignty over the islands.
- The judge believes that a dispute exists based on Nicaragua's claim to sovereignty over the islands in its submissions included in the Memorial.
- The court lacks jurisdiction over the part of the dispute concerning the islands attributed to Colombia by the 1928 Treaty, as the reservation in the Colombian declaration limits the application of the declaration to disputes arising after January 6, 1932.
- All the facts related to the content and validity of the 1928 Treaty predate 1932, making the dispute outside the court's jurisdiction.
- Nicaragua contends that the 1928 Treaty was terminated due to a breach committed by Colombia, but these facts occurred after 1932.
- The judge concludes that Colombia's wide interpretation of the scope of the 1928 Treaty, even if incorrect, does not constitute a material breach.
