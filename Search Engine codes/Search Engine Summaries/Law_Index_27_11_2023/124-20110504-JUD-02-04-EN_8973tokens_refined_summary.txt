Title: Territorial and Maritime Dispute (Nicaragua v. Colombia)

Case Overview:
The case involves a territorial and maritime dispute between Nicaragua and Colombia. Nicaragua filed an application in 2001, and Colombia raised preliminary objections to jurisdiction in 2003, leading to the suspension of proceedings on the merits.

Important Details:
- Costa Rica applied to intervene in the case, citing an interest in the adjacent maritime spaces.
- The International Court of Justice (ICJ) dismissed Costa Rica's application, questioning whether its interest is of a legal nature.
- The ICJ considered the concept of an "interest of a legal nature" and its origins in the work of the Advisory Committee of Jurists appointed by the League of Nations in 1920.
- The Court recognized that an interest of a legal nature must be recognized by the applicable rules of international law.
- The dissenting judges argued that the Court's decision was based on policy grounds rather than a determination of Costa Rica's demonstrated interest.
- The dissenting judges believed that the Court had misconstrued the scope and object of Article 62 of the ICJ Statute, which allows for non-party intervention.
- The Court's approach was criticized for potentially closing the door to future applications for intervention, especially in territorial and maritime delimitations.
