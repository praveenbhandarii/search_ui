Case Summary:

The case concerns the deportation of M.S., a national of Afghanistan, who claimed that his deportation would violate articles 10, 15, 16, and 25 of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. The author, a person with complex posttraumatic stress disorder and generalized anxiety disorder, was denied a residence permit in Sweden and faces deportation. The state party argues that the communication should be held inadmissible and that the claims under articles 10, 15, and 16 do not disclose any violation of the Convention.

Procedural History:

- The author fled violence in Afghanistan with his family when he was 5 months old and lived in the Islamic Republic of Iran for 13 years without being granted a residence permit.
- The author applied for asylum in Sweden in 2015, but his application was rejected.
- The Swedish Migration Agency and the Migration Court rejected the author's appeal and subsequent applications for a residence permit.
- The Migration Court of Appeal upheld the decisions of the lower courts.
- The author submitted a communication to the Committee on 20 August 2019, claiming that his deportation to Afghanistan would violate the Convention.
- The Committee requested interim measures to the State party to refrain from removing the author to Afghanistan while his case was pending before the Committee.
- The State party submitted observations on admissibility and the merits, arguing that the communication should be held inadmissible on several grounds and that it revealed no violation of the Convention.
- The author submitted comments on the State party's observations, arguing that the communication should be declared admissible in all its parts and that it revealed a clear violation of the Convention.
- The State party requested that the Committee discontinue its consideration of the communication on May 5, 2021, as the decision to expel the author had become statute-barred on May 16, 2021.
- The Committee decided to discontinue the consideration of communication No. 66/2019 on September 6, 2021, taking into account the fact that the expulsion decision had become statute-barred and the author no longer faced a risk of being returned to Afghanistan.

Legal Analysis and Reasoning:

The Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities found that the communication should be declared admissible in all its parts and that it revealed a clear violation of the Convention. The state party's request to discontinue the consideration of the communication was accepted, as the decision to expel the author had become statute-barred.

Decisions and Rulings:

The Committee found that the communication should be declared admissible in all its parts and that it revealed a clear violation of the Convention. The state party's request to discontinue the consideration of the communication was accepted.

Impact and Significance:

It also underscores the importance of considering the specific circumstances of individuals with disabilities in the context of immigration proceedings.
