- Case Name: Communication No. 59/2016, Petitioners v. Finland
- Case ID: CERD/C/106/D/59/2016
- Court/Tribunal: Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination (CERD)
- Document Details: The document is a communication submitted to the CERD by 23 petitioners representing the Saami community in Finland. The communication alleges violations of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (ICERD) by Finland.
- Document Dates: March 14, 2016 (submission date)
- Key Parties Involved: Petitioners (Saami community members), Finland (Respondent State)

Procedural History:

- The communication was submitted to the CERD on March 14, 2016.
- The CERD declared the communication admissible and proceeded to examine the merits of the case.
- The State party, Finland, submitted its observations on the merits of the communication.
- The petitioners provided their comments in response to the State party's observations.

Legal Analysis and Reasoning:

- The petitioners allege that Finland has violated their rights under articles 1 and 5 (a), (c), and (e) of the ICERD.
- They argue that the definition of "Sami" in the Act on the Sami Parliament is too narrow and violates their rights as Indigenous Peoples.
- The petitioners also claim that the Supreme Administrative Court's rulings in at least 53 cases were based on an overall consideration of the individuals' connection to the Sami culture, rather than on the objective criteria established by the Act.
- They argue that this approach has resulted in discrimination and arbitrariness, with identical cases being treated differently and significant differences between various situations being ignored.
- The petitioners further contend that the State party has violated article 5 (c) of the ICERD by intervening in the operation of the Sami Parliament directly related to Sami political participation.
- They also claim that the linguistic rights protected by article 5 (e) of the ICERD were violated, as the gradual takeover of the Sami Parliament by the mainstream Finnish population would have an adverse effect on the exercise and enjoyment of the economic, social, and cultural rights of the Sami people.

Decisions and Rulings:

- The Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination has found that Finland's definition of "Sami" for the purposes of voting in the Sami Parliament is too narrow and violates the rights of Indigenous Sami individuals under the ICERD.
- The Committee has recommended that Finland give more adequate weight to self-identification by individuals concerned.

Impact and Significance:

- The case highlights the importance of ensuring that the rights of Indigenous peoples are protected and respected, particularly in regards to their right to participate in decision-making processes that affect their lives and communities.
- The Committee's findings have implications for the rights of Indigenous peoples globally, and serve as a reminder to states to ensure that their laws and policies are in line with international human rights standards.

Context Summary:
The case revolves around the Sami people's right to collectively determine the composition of the Sami Parliament and participate in public affairs. The petitioners alleged that the State party violated their rights under Article 5(c) of the Convention by not ensuring that the criteria for eligibility to vote in Sami Parliament elections are defined in a manner that respects the right of the Sami people to provide their free, prior, and informed consent on matters relating to their own membership and political participation.

Legal Analysis:
The Committee found no violation of Article 5(a) of the Convention as the petitioners were not parties to the proceedings, and there was no additional information in the file to suggest that their right to equal treatment before the tribunals and all other organs administering justice had been violated. However, the Committee found a violation of Article 5(c) of the Convention by the State party for failing to ensure that the criteria for eligibility to vote in Sami Parliament elections respect the Sami people's right to provide their free, prior, and informed consent on matters relating to their membership and political participation. The Committee also considered that the State party's failure to negotiate with the Sami people regarding the review of Section 3 of the Act on the Sami Parliament violated Article 5(e) of the Convention.

Issues and Reasoning:
The main issue in this case is whether the State party violated the petitioners' rights under Article 5(c) and 5(e) of the Convention by not ensuring that the criteria for eligibility to vote in Sami Parliament elections are defined in a manner that respects the Sami people's right to provide their free, prior, and informed consent on matters relating to their membership and political participation. The Committee reasoned that the State party's failure to negotiate with the Sami people regarding the review of Section 3 of the Act on the Sami Parliament violated the Sami people's right to self-determination and their right to participate in the conduct of public affairs.

Relevance and Implications:
This decision is significant because it highlights the importance of respecting the rights of indigenous peoples to participate in the conduct of public affairs and to have their consent in matters relating to their membership and political participation. It also emphasizes the need for States to engage in good faith negotiations with indigenous peoples regarding issues that affect their rights and interests.
