Case Summary:
The case involves a Slovak citizen, Mr. Lacko, who was denied service at a restaurant because he is Roma. The restaurant owner has a history of discriminating against Roma people, and Mr. Lacko was only admitted to the restaurant on some days when he was considered "polite." The petitioner's lawyer claims that the restaurant owner's actions constitute racial discrimination and violate several articles of the European Convention on Human Rights. The State party argues that the petitioner failed to exhaust domestic remedies available to him, but the Committee found that there were no effective remedies available to the petitioner under Slovak law.

Procedural History:
- The petitioner, Miroslav Lacko, filed a complaint with the United Nations Human Rights Committee.
- The Committee reviewed the case and requested information from both the petitioner and the State party.
- The State party argued that the petitioner failed to exhaust domestic remedies available to him.
- The Committee found that there were no effective remedies available to the petitioner under Slovak law.
- The Committee requested the State party and the petitioner to provide information about domestic legislation and remedies intended to protect one's right of access to any place or service intended for use by the general public without distinction as to race, colour, or national or ethnic origin.
- The Regional Prosecution Office initially found that the respondent had been justified in refusing service to the petitioner based on their ethnicity.
- The Prosecutor General disagreed with the Regional Prosecution Office's decision and opined that the respondent had committed a crime of inciting to national or racial hatred.
- The Kosice District Prosecutor indicted the respondent, and the court found the respondent guilty of the crime described in Article 198a, Section 1 of the Penal Code.
- The court sentenced the respondent to pay a fine of SKK 5000 or serve a term of three months imprisonment.

Legal Analysis and Reasoning:
- The case raises issues of racial discrimination and the failure of the State party to provide effective remedies to address such discrimination.
- The Committee found that the petitioner had exhausted all available domestic remedies, and that there were no effective criminal or civil remedies available to him under Slovak law.
- The Committee considered the arguments and evidence presented by both parties and analyzed the relevant provisions of the European Convention on Human Rights and the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination.
- The Committee emphasized the importance of providing equal access to public accommodations for all individuals, regardless of their race, ethnicity, or national origin.
- The Committee considered the delay in the legal proceedings and found that the condemnation of the respondent and the penalty imposed, even though delayed, constituted sanctions compatible with the obligations of the State party.

Decisions and Rulings:
- The Committee found that the refusal of service to the petitioner based on his race constituted a violation of the European Convention on Human Rights.
- The Committee requested the State party to provide compensation to the petitioner for the discrimination he experienced, and to take measures to ensure that racial discrimination is not practiced at the restaurant.
- The Committee also called on the State party to adopt legislation expressly prohibiting and providing effective remedies for racial discrimination in public accommodations.
- The court found the respondent guilty of the crime of inciting to national or racial hatred and sentenced the respondent to pay a fine or serve a term of imprisonment.

Impact and Significance:
- This case highlights the ongoing issue of racial discrimination against the Roma minority in Slovakia and the need for effective remedies to address such discrimination.
- The Committee's decision emphasizes the importance of providing equal access to public accommodations for all individuals, regardless of their race, ethnicity, or national origin.
- The case has implications for the implementation of anti-discrimination policies and laws in Slovakia and beyond.
- The Committee's recommendation that the State party take measures to ensure that the procedure for the investigation of violations is not unduly prolonged has implications for the efficiency and effectiveness of the legal system in addressing discrimination cases.
