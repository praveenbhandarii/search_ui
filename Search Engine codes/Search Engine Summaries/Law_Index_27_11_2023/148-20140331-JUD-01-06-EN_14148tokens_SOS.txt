Title: Whaling in the Antarctic (Australia v. Japan: New Zealand intervening)

Case Overview:
The case involves Australia's allegations that Japan's whaling program, JARPA II, violated its obligations under the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling (ICRW) and other international obligations for the preservation of marine mammals and the marine environment.

Document Overview:
This document is a judgment from the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in Case Number 148. It provides details about the case, including the date of the judgment, the presiding judges, and relevant instruments such as the ICRW, Schedule, Annex P, and Guidelines. The document also includes information about the International Whaling Commission (IWC) and its Scientific Committee's assessment of whaling permits.

Important Details:
- The ICJ applied a standard of reasonableness to evaluate the design and implementation of JARPA II in relation to its stated objectives.
- The ICJ used the standard of reasonableness for the first time in the 2012 Advisory Opinion on the IFAD and considered its use in other cases.
- The ICJ assessed the legality of Japan's conduct in issuing special permits for JARPA II under Article VIII of the ICRW.
- The ICJ focused on the lawfulness of the special permits and did not review the design and implementation of the research program itself.
- The ICJ emphasized the need for compliance with the procedural and substantive requirements of the ICRW and the importance of whaling programs providing essential information for rational management and conservation.
- The ICJ found that the special permits granted by Japan were not for scientific research purposes and breached Japan's treaty obligations under the ICRW.
- The document discusses the shift in attitudes and societal values towards whaling, reflected in amendments to the Schedule and the adoption of a moratorium in 1982.
- The ICJ considered recent developments in the regulatory framework of the Convention when assessing the continued conduct of JARPA II.
- The document raises doubts about the conclusion that JARPA II is commercial whaling, considering the use of nonlethal methods and the scientific outputs produced exclusively with the use of data arising from these methods.

Additional Information:
- The document includes information about the International Whaling Commission (IWC) and its Scientific Committee's assessment of whaling permits.
- The document discusses the criteria and guidelines for special permit proposals and the need for research programs to contribute to the comprehensive assessment and management of whale stocks.
- The ICJ's decision contradicted its other conclusions regarding the special permits granted by Japan.
- The document provides details about the case, including the case number, date, and judge.
- The document also includes information about the International Court of Justice (ICJ) and its role in the case.
- The document discusses the importance of compliance with the ICRW's requirements and the need for whaling programs to align with conservationist approaches.
