Procedural History:
- The case was brought before the United Nations Committee on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (CERD) by the Thai-Danish Association (DACoRD) against Denmark.
- The communication was submitted in March 2013.

Legal Analysis and Reasoning:
- The petitioners claimed that Denmark violated their rights under Article 6 in relation to Article 2, paragraph 1(d) and Article 5(f) of the Convention.
- The petitioners argued that the respondent State party failed to exhaust domestic remedies and that the case is inadmissible ratione personae and ratione materiae.
- The case involves a TV broadcast by the Danish Broadcasting Network DR on 3 January 2006, in which a journalist pretended to be looking for a flight ticket and asked if he would be offered a discount as an ethnic Thai.
- DACoRD filed a complaint against Thai Airways and Thai Travel for discriminatory practices, but the Copenhagen Metropolitan police did not find evidence of an ethnic motive.
- The General Director of Public Prosecution in Denmark rejected the appeal brought by DACoRD on the basis that the petitioners did not have a legal standing in the case.
- The CERD Committee emphasized that only individuals who can demonstrate that they have been directly or indirectly subjected to and/or affected by the alleged discriminatory practice can bring a claim.
- The decision also underscores the importance of considering the effectiveness of available remedies in determining whether a complaint is admissible.

Decisions and Rulings:
- The United Nations Committee on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (CERD) considered the communication and made a decision.
- The Committee found that the state party had violated the petitioners' rights by not providing an effective remedy for discrimination based on ethnic origin.
- The Committee also found that the state party's arguments regarding exhaustion of domestic remedies and lack of standing were not persuasive.

Impact and Significance:
- The case highlights the importance of providing effective remedies for victims of racial discrimination.
- The decision reinforces the obligation of states to protect individuals from discrimination based on their race or ethnic origin.
- The decision also emphasizes the need for individuals to demonstrate direct or indirect harm in order to bring a claim of racial discrimination.
