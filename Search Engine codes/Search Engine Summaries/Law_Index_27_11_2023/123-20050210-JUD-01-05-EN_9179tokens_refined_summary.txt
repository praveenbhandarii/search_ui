Title: Certain Property (Liechtenstein v. Germany)

Case Overview:
Liechtenstein filed an application against Germany at the International Court of Justice, initiating proceedings related to a dispute over certain property. The case involves issues of jurisdiction, admissibility, interpretation of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, and obligations of neutral states during World War II. The dispute centers around the confiscation of neutral property during the war, with Liechtenstein arguing that the German courts' reliance on the Settlement Convention and Allied High Commission Law No. 63 is not appropriate for addressing the question of neutral property confiscated as if it were German.

Important Details:
- Germany lodged six preliminary objections, including jurisdiction and admissibility.
- Key issues include the interpretation of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, duty of a judge ad hoc, jurisdiction and admissibility of the Court, and obligations of neutral states.
- Germany's positions on the case have changed over time, with the German delegation recognizing the need for a solution through a judicial decision or an ad hoc understanding between the parties.
- The Court has faced challenges in handling the case during the preliminary objections phase, with the German courts and government relying on the Settlement Convention and Allied High Commission Law No. 63.
- Judge ad hoc Berman's dissenting opinion is significant, highlighting the unique nature of Liechtenstein's claim and the need for legal creativity.
- The Court rejected Germany's preliminary objection regarding the absence of a dispute between the parties but accepted the objection based on the exception ratione temporis.
- The Court found that the limitation ratione temporis was contained in an agreed treaty instrument, raising questions about the application of the Settlement Convention to non-parties.
- The case also raises questions about the intentions of the Three Powers when drafting Chapter Six of the Settlement Convention and the scope of the reparations regime.
- The Court cited Articles 34 and 35 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties to support its decision.
