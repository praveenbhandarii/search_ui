Title: Whaling in the Antarctic (Australia v. Japan: New Zealand intervening)

Case Overview:
This case, numbered 148, involves a dispute between Australia and Japan regarding Japan's large-scale whaling program in the Antarctic. Australia alleges that Japan's program, known as JARPA II, violates its obligations under the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling (ICRW) and other international obligations for the preservation of marine mammals and the marine environment.

Document Overview:
This judgment document, dated March 31, 2014, is a JUD type document from the International Court of Justice (ICJ). It contains important information regarding the court's findings and reasoning in the case. The document details are as follows: Case Number: 148, Language: English, File-name: 148-20140331-JUD-01-03-EN_3019tokens_SOS.txt. The judge presiding over the case is Judge Keith.

Important Details:
- The case concerns Japan's whaling practices in the Antarctic and is being heard by the ICJ.
- The ICJ is reviewing Japan's decision to grant a special permit for scientific research whaling in the Antarctic.
- The court is assessing whether Japan's decision to award the special permit is objectively justifiable and supported by coherent scientific reasoning.
- The court is also examining Japan's use of lethal methods for scientific research whaling and the determination of sample sizes.
- The interpretation of Article VIII(1) of the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling, which grants Contracting Governments the power to issue special permits for scientific research whaling, is central to the case.
- The court has previously established a test for the standard of review, requiring the decision to award a special permit to be objectively justifiable based on coherent scientific reasoning.
- The court has found that the Japanese authorities failed to address key aspects of the program's design and implementation, including the use of lethal methods and the determination of sample sizes.
- The court has not yet issued a final ruling in the ongoing case.
- Australia, supported by New Zealand and the International Whaling Commission (IWC), challenges Japan's whaling program, arguing that it does not meet the requirements of the ICRW and is conducted for commercial purposes rather than scientific research.
- Japan has been unable to provide coherent scientific reasoning for crucial elements of the program, such as the use of lethal methods and the increase in the target for minke whales.
- Japan has also failed to report to the IWC and its Scientific Committee on the consequences of reduced takes of minke whales, fin whales, and the absence of humpback whale takes.
- The court concludes that Japan's whaling program violates the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling as it does not fall within the exception for scientific research.

Additional Information:
