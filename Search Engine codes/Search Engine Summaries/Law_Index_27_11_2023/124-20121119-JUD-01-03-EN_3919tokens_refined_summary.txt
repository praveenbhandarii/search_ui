Title: Territorial and Maritime Dispute (Nicaragua v. Colombia)

Case Overview:
The case involves a territorial and maritime dispute between Nicaragua and Colombia. Nicaragua filed an application in 2001, and Colombia raised preliminary objections to jurisdiction in 2003, leading to the suspension of proceedings on the merits.

Important Details:
- The International Court of Justice (ICJ) recognized in 1969 that various methods may be used concurrently for delimitation.
- The Court proposed adjustments to the provisional median line to achieve an equitable result in drawing the maritime boundary.
- The ratio of relevant coasts is about 8:1 in Nicaragua's favor, making the provisional median line inadequate.
- The Court emphasized the need to avoid cutoff effects for each party and the principle that land dominates the sea.
- The Court rejected the argument that the equidistance/median line rule is declaratory of customary international law.
- Multiple methods of delimitation may be used concurrently, and the Court prioritized delimitation by agreement.
- The Court proposed using a combination of latitudinal lines and the starting point for the southern line to achieve an equitable result.

Document Details:
This judgment, issued by the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea (ITLOS) on 14 March 2012, discusses the delimitation of the maritime boundary between Nicaragua and Colombia in the Caribbean Sea. Judge Keith agrees with the Court's conclusions, except for the law to be applied to the delimitation. The document provides a detailed analysis of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) and its Article 6 regarding delimitation. It highlights the two main approaches to delimitation and the negotiations that led to the adoption of the Convention in 1982. The document also mentions the Virginia Commentary on the Convention, which provides valuable insights into the contest between the two approaches.

Additional Information:
The document contains relevant citations and dates, including the judgment date of 14 March 2012. It also refers to another case, Costa Rica v. Nicaragua, and the judge's opinion on certain cays not being accorded more than their territorial sea. The judge agrees with the boundaries set by the Court to achieve an equitable result, emphasizing overall proportionality and avoiding a cutoff effect for both parties.
