Title: Case Name: Nicaragua v. Costa Rica, Case Number: ICJ Rep 1986, Date of Judgment: 22 July 1986, Judges: Judge Koroma (dissenting), Judge Iglesias (separate opinion), Document Details: ICJ Reports 1986

Overview:
The document is a separate opinion of Judge ad hoc Dugard in a case involving Costa Rica and Nicaragua regarding the Isla Portillos territorial dispute. The International Court of Justice (ICJ) recognized Costa Rica's plausible right to territorial sovereignty over the disputed territory and ordered both parties to refrain from sending civilian, police, or security personnel to the area.

Important Details:
- The Court ordered both parties to refrain from sending civilian, police, or security personnel to the disputed territory, but recognized Costa Rica's stronger claim to the territory.
- Judge Dugard criticized the Court's decision for being unfair to Costa Rica, as it requires both parties to vacate the disputed territory, while Nicaragua has already sent military and environmental personnel.
- The document discusses the concept of "plausible right" and the requirement for an applicant state to demonstrate that the rights it asserts are at least plausible in order to obtain provisional measures.
- The Court has previously held that the applicant state must show that it has some prospect of success on the merits of the case or that it has established the existence of the right it seeks to have protected on a prima facie basis.
- Judge Dugard argues that the Court should give greater recognition to the applicant's claim by ordering a return to the status quo ante, rather than adopting an evenhanded approach to the territorial claims.
- The case involves Costa Rica's claim of sovereignty over the disputed territory of Isla Portillos and Nicaragua's infringement of its environmental rights in the territory.
- The Court considered the test of plausibility to determine the standard of proof required for provisional measures.
- The test of plausibility requires the applicant state to show that its claim is reasonable or probable, and that there is a serious issue to be tried on the merits.
- The Court accepted that Costa Rica's right to sovereignty and territorial integrity over the Isla Portillos was plausible, based on the 1858 Treaty of Limits and the 1897 First Alexander Award.
- The Court ordered provisional measures to protect Costa Rica's territorial integrity and environmental rights pending a final decision on the merits.
- The case is at least arguable on the merits, and Costa Rica has a prima facie case or a serious issue to be tried on the merits.
- The ICJ found that Costa Rica has a plausible right to sovereignty over the Isla Portillos and that Nicaragua's claim to sovereignty is not plausible.
- The ICJ also stated that respect for territorial integrity is a fundamental principle of the international legal order and that any order in the case must take into account the question of the appropriate order in light of the principle of territorial integrity.

Additional Information:
- The ICJ has ordered both parties to refrain from any action that might aggravate the dispute and to keep out of the disputed territory.
- The ICJ has permitted Costa Rica to take measures to protect the environment of the territory, including the cao, while consulting with the Secretariat of the Ramsar Convention and giving prior notice to Nicaragua.
- The ICJ's decision was based on the facts of the case and the applicable international law, including the Treaty of 1858, the First Alexander Award, and the United Nations Charter.
- The case was brought before the ICJ pursuant to the Statute of the International Court of Justice, which provides for the settlement of disputes between states through judicial processes.
- The ICJ's judgment in the case is final and binding on the parties, and the ICJ has the power to provide provisional measures to protect the rights of the parties pending the final determination of the dispute.
