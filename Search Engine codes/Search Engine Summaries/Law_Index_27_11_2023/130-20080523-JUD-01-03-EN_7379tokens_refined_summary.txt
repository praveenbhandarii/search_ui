Title: Sovereignty over Pedra Branca/Pulau Batu Puteh, Middle Rocks and South Ledge (Malaysia/Singapore)

Case Overview:
The case involves a dispute between Malaysia and Singapore over the sovereignty of Pedra Branca/Pulau Batu Puteh, Middle Rocks, and South Ledge. The parties jointly approached the International Court of Justice (ICJ) to determine the ownership of these maritime features. The Court's judgment would be final and binding on both countries.

Important Details:
- Judges Simma and Abraham dissent from the majority opinion of the Court, arguing that sovereignty over Pedra Branca/Pulau Batu Puteh does not belong to Singapore.
- The dissenting judges disagree with the majority's interpretation of the facts and the law, particularly regarding the period before the construction of Horsburgh lighthouse on the island in 1844.
- They contend that the evidence does not support the Court's conclusion that sovereignty over the island passed from the Sultanate of Johor to Singapore.
- The dissenting opinion highlights two legal bases for the Court's decision: tacit agreement and acquiescence. However, the judges argue that the Court failed to choose between these bases and that the parties' conduct does not support a transfer of sovereignty.
- The judges emphasize the importance of the original sovereign's consent to the transfer of sovereignty and argue that there is no evidence of such consent in this case.
- The Court analyzes the conduct of the parties over a long period to determine the holder of sovereignty over Pedra Branca/Pulau Batu Puteh.
- The Court concludes that the island is now under the sovereignty of Singapore based on a gradual process of transfer deduced from the parties' conduct since 1850.
- The judgment establishes legal principles on the transfer of sovereignty, including the requirement for an express agreement between the former and new sovereign, which was not fully met in this case.
- The dissenting judges suggest that acquisitive prescription, a concept encompassing tacit agreement and acquiescence, may be more relevant for the transfer of territorial sovereignty.
- The case underscores the importance of carefully analyzing the language and context of legal documents to accurately determine their meaning and significance.

Document Details:
This document is a joint dissenting opinion of Judges Simma and Abraham. It provides a detailed critique of the majority opinion and presents alternative legal arguments. The dissenting judges question the Court's reasoning and highlight the lack of evidence supporting the transfer of sovereignty to Singapore. The document also discusses the legal principles applied by the Court and suggests alternative concepts for the transfer of territorial sovereignty.

Additional Information:
The case involves the disputed sovereignty of Pedra Branca/Pulau Batu Puteh between Malaysia and Singapore. The Court analyzed the conduct of the parties to determine if there was any clear manifestation of sovereignty over the island. The Court found that neither party demonstrated clear sovereignty, and the exchange of correspondence in 1953 did not provide conclusive evidence. The case emphasizes the importance of state sovereignty over territory and the need for a visible and manifest display of state power to establish sovereignty.
