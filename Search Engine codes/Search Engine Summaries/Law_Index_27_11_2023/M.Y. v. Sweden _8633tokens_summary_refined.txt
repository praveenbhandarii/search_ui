Case Details:

- Case ID: CRPD/C/24/D/49/2018
- Court/Tribunal: Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities
- Document Details: Decision adopted by the Committee under article 2 of the Optional Protocol, concerning communication No. 49/2018
- Document Dates: March 2019

Procedural History:
- The author, M.Y., a national of Afghanistan, filed a communication with the Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, alleging that his deportation to Afghanistan would violate his rights under the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.
- The Committee reviewed the communication and adopted a decision in March 2019.

Legal Analysis and Reasoning:
- The Committee found that the author's claims were substantiated and that Sweden would violate the author's rights under articles 15, 16, and 26 of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities if it were to deport him to Afghanistan.
- The Committee also found that the author has a well-founded fear of persecution based on his disability and that his deportation would expose him to a real risk of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.
- The Committee notes that the communication is inadmissible under article 2(e) of the Optional Protocol to the CRPD due to the author's failure to provide sufficient reasons to challenge the domestic assessment.
- The Committee refers to its jurisprudence in O.O.J. et al. v. Sweden and N.L. v. Sweden, which established that the removal of an individual to a jurisdiction where they would risk facing violations of the Convention could engage the responsibility of the removing State under the Convention.
- The Committee considers that the principle of non-refoulement imposes a duty on a State party to refrain from removing a person from its territory when there is a real risk that the person would be subjected to serious violations of Convention rights amounting to a risk of irreparable harm.

Decisions and Rulings:
- The Committee decided that Sweden would violate the author's rights under articles 15, 16, and 26 of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities if it were to deport him to Afghanistan.
- The Committee found that the author has a well-founded fear of persecution based on his disability and that his deportation would expose him to a real risk of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.

Impact and Significance:
- This case highlights the importance of considering the specific vulnerabilities of individuals with disabilities when assessing their risk of persecution in their home country.
- The decision sets a precedent for future cases involving the expulsion of individuals with disabilities to countries where they may face a risk of torture or ill-treatment.
- The decision also emphasizes the duty of a State party to refrain from removing a person from its territory when there is a real risk of serious violations of Convention rights amounting to a risk of irreparable harm.
