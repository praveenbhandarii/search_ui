Title: Territorial and Maritime Dispute (Nicaragua v. Colombia)

Case Overview:
The Republic of Nicaragua filed a dispute against the Republic of Colombia regarding territorial and maritime delimitation. Nicaragua submitted its Memorial within the specified time limit, but Colombia raised preliminary objections to jurisdiction, resulting in the suspension of the proceedings on the merits.

Important Details:
- Costa Rica's application to intervene in the case was deemed inadmissible by the majority of the Court.
- The Court ruled that the Judgment on the merits would protect Nicaragua's legal interest, but a third State may still seek to intervene to contribute to the determination of its legal interest.
- The only mechanism for a third State to intervene is to request permission under Article 62 of the Statute.
- Equatorial Guinea was granted permission to intervene in a previous case related to maritime delimitation, but this fact did not serve as a justification for granting permission in this case.
- The Court did not find compelling reasons in the Judgment to revert to its earlier and more restrictive jurisprudence on the admissibility of intervention in maritime delimitation cases.
- Although the Court may consider information provided by a party that unsuccessfully sought permission to intervene when deciding the merits, it is paradoxical that the only way for a third State to submit information about its legal interest is through an inadmissible application.
