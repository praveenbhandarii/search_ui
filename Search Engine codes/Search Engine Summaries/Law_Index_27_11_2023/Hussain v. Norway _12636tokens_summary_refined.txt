Summary:

Case Details:
The case, Sajjad Hussain v. Norway, was brought before the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination (CERD) under communication No. 61/2016. The case involves a Pakistani national who was detained in Norway on charges of human trafficking and absconding. The Borgarting Court of Appeal prolonged the person's pretrial detention, and the Committee is reviewing whether this decision amounted to discrimination based on race, color, national or ethnic origin.

Procedural History:
The author, Sajjad Hussain, filed a communication with the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination (CERD) in March 2016, alleging violations of his rights under the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. The Committee has been considering the case and has now issued a decision.

Legal Analysis and Reasoning:
The Committee has considered the facts of the case and has determined that there is no violation of the Convention. The State party argued that the Court's statement about the person's Pakistani background contributing to the risk of absconding should be understood as a reference to the person's connection to Pakistan, and not to his race, color, descent, or national or ethnic origin. The Committee found that the State party's arguments do not constitute an obstacle to declaring the admissibility of the communication.

Decisions and Rulings:
The Committee has determined that there is no violation of the Convention in this case. The Committee's decision is based on its interpretation of the Convention and its application to the facts of the case.

Impact and Significance:
The decision has implications for the interpretation and application of the Convention in similar cases. It highlights the importance of considering the specific circumstances and context when assessing allegations of discrimination based on race, color, or national or ethnic origin.
