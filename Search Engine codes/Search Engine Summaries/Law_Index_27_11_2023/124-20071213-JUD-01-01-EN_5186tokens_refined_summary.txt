Title: Territorial and Maritime Dispute (Nicaragua v. Colombia)

Case Overview:
The case involves a territorial and maritime dispute between Nicaragua and Colombia. Nicaragua filed an application in 2001, initiating proceedings against Colombia regarding a group of related legal issues concerning territory and maritime delimitation. Colombia filed preliminary objections to jurisdiction, leading to the suspension of the proceedings on the merits.

Important Details:
- The dispute revolves around the validity of the 1928 Treaty and 1930 Protocol, which Nicaragua argues are invalid due to coercion.
- The Court decided to dispose of the validity of the Treaty and Protocol at the preliminary objections stage without adequately discussing the issue of coercion.
- Nicaragua argues that the Court should have left the matter to be resolved on the merits rather than deciding it at the preliminary stage.
- The Court's decision was based on the principle that a party raising preliminary objections is entitled to have these objections answered at the preliminary stage, unless the Court does not have all the necessary facts or if answering the objection would determine the dispute on the merits.
- The Court found itself in neither of these situations in the present case.
- The Judgment did not provide a reasoned decision on the issue of coercion, and the only motivation given for deciding the issue at the preliminary stage was to avoid resolving it on the merits.
