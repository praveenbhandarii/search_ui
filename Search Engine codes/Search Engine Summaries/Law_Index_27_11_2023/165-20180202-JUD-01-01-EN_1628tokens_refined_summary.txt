Title: Land Boundary in the Northern Part of Isla Portillos (Costa Rica v. Nicaragua)

Case Overview:
This case, numbered 165, involves a dispute between Costa Rica and Nicaragua regarding the precise definition of the boundary in the area of Los Portillos/Harbor Head Lagoon and the establishment of a new military camp by Nicaragua on the beach of Isla Portillos. Costa Rica filed an Application instituting proceedings against Nicaragua on 16 January 2017.

Important Details:
- The International Court of Justice (ICJ) delimitated the maritime boundary between Nicaragua and Costa Rica in the Caribbean Sea and the Baha de San Juan del Norte.
- The Court considered the concave coast of Nicaragua and the short convex coast of Costa Rica adjacent to it.
- The initial part of the delimitation line caused a "cut-off" effect on Nicaragua's coast, leading the Court to determine that an adjustment of the boundary line was necessary for a more equitable solution.
- The Court did not take into account any entitlement resulting from the sandbar separating Harbor Head Lagoon from the Caribbean Sea.
- The Court observed that attributing territorial waters to the enclave would be of little use to Nicaragua while disrupting the continuity of Costa Rica's territorial sea.

Document Details:
The document, titled "International Court of Justice (ICJ) Reports 2012 (II)," provides key provisions related to the delimitation of the boundary. It cites Articles 74 and 83 of the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) as the applicable law for delimitation. The Court's function is to achieve an equitable solution when the States involved fail to reach an agreement, and its decision on the delimitation line is binding on the parties. The Court's jurisprudence emphasizes that a boundary line should not result in a "cut-off" of one party's maritime projections, and provisional equidistance lines may need adjustment to achieve fairness. A sketchmap is included in the document, illustrating the initial part of the delimitation line that cuts off Nicaragua's coastal projections.
