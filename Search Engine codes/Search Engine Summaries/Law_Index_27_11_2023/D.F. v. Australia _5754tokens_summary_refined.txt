Case Summary:
The Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination considered a petition submitted by an individual alleging discrimination based on national origin. The petitioner, a New Zealand citizen residing in Australia, argued that he was discriminated against based on his national origin when he was denied social security benefits. The State party contested the petitioner's claim, arguing that the provisions of the Family and Community Services Legislation Amendment (New Zealand Citizens) Act of 2001 did not result in any distinctions based on national origin. The Committee found that the petitioner had sufficiently substantiated his claims of racial discrimination and that the communication was therefore admissible.

Procedural History:
The petitioner, D.F., filed a communication with the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination alleging discrimination based on national origin. The State party, Australia, contested the admissibility of the communication, arguing that the provisions of the Family and Community Services Legislation Amendment (New Zealand Citizens) Act of 2001 did not discriminate against the petitioner based on his national origin. The Committee considered the admissibility of the communication and found that the petitioner had sufficiently substantiated his claims of racial discrimination.

Legal Analysis and Reasoning:
The Committee analyzed the petitioner's claim of discrimination based on national origin in relation to the Family and Community Services Legislation Amendment (New Zealand Citizens) Act of 2001. The State party argued that the Act did not result in any distinctions based on national origin. However, the Committee found that the petitioner had provided sufficient evidence to support his claims of racial discrimination. The Committee noted that the State party had not contested the petitioner's claim that he was denied social security benefits based on his national origin. The Committee also found that the limitation on the petitioner's ability to access certain social security benefits was not based on his national origin but on the fact that he was neither a permanent resident nor an Australian citizen. The Committee concluded that the petitioner had exhausted domestic remedies by virtue of his complaint to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunities Commission (HREOC).

Impact and Significance:
The decision in D.F. v. Australia highlights the importance of considering the potential impact of legislation on individuals based on their national origin. The Committee found that the petitioner had demonstrated sufficient evidence to support his claims of racial discrimination and that the State party had not adequately addressed the issue of discrimination based on national origin. The decision emphasizes the need for States to ensure that their laws and policies do not perpetuate discrimination based on national origin and that individuals are entitled to equal treatment under the law, regardless of their nationality.
