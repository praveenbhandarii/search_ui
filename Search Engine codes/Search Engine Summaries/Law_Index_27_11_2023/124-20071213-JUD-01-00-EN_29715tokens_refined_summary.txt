Title: Territorial and Maritime Dispute (Nicaragua v. Colombia)

Case Overview:
The case involves a territorial and maritime dispute between Nicaragua and Colombia over the Roncador, Quitasueo, and Serrana islands, as well as the surrounding waters. The dispute originated from the 1928 Treaty and 1930 Protocol, which established the maritime boundary between the two countries. Nicaragua claims that the 1928 Treaty is null and void due to historical context and infringement of its national constitution, while Colombia and the United States argue that the treaty is valid and Nicaragua's claims are unfounded.

Important Details:
- Nicaragua filed an application in 2001, requesting the International Court of Justice (ICJ) to declare that Colombia violated its sovereignty over the islands and intervening banks and reefs.
- Colombia objected to the jurisdiction of the ICJ, arguing that the dispute should be settled diplomatically.
- The ICJ rejected Colombia's preliminary objections and held that it has jurisdiction over the dispute.
- The ICJ found that the 1928 Treaty and 1930 Protocol did not settle the matters in dispute and that the Court has jurisdiction over questions of sovereignty and maritime delimitation.
- The ICJ's judgment establishes that the dispute cannot be settled through diplomatic means alone.
- The Court's decision also addresses the issue of the Archipelago, including the scope and composition of the San Andrs Archipelago and the sovereignty over Roncador, Quitasueo, and Serrana islands.

Document Details:
The document is a judgment issued by the ICJ on December 13, 2007. It includes arguments and evidence presented by both parties regarding sovereignty, the validity of the treaties, and maritime delimitation. The case was heard by a panel of judges, including President Higgins, Vice-President AlKhasawneh, Judges Shi, Koroma, ParraAranguren, Buergenthal, Owada, Simma, Tomka, Abraham, Keith, SeplvedaAmor, and Skotnikov. The document is cited as ICJ, Series A/B, No. 77, p. 76. The judgment was delivered at the Peace Palace in The Hague and is available in both French and English, with the French text being authoritative.

Additional Information:
- The dispute has been ongoing since 1972 and has involved diplomatic exchanges between the parties.
- It has also been the subject of legal opinions and declarations, including the 1980 White Paper issued by Nicaragua and the United States Legal Position aidememoire presented to Nicaragua in 1981.
- In 1993, Colombian helicopters intercepted two Nicaraguan fishing vessels in the disputed area, and the Colombian coastguard seized a Honduran fishing vessel with a fishing permit issued by Nicaragua.
- The case has attracted international attention due to its significance in establishing the jurisdiction of the ICJ in territorial and maritime disputes.
- The Court's judgment addresses the issue of the Archipelago, including the sovereignty over the islands, islets, and cays forming part of the San Andrs Archipelago, and the delimitation of maritime spaces between Colombia and Nicaragua.
