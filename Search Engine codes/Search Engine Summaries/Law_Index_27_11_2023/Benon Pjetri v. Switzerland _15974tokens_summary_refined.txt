Case Summary:

Mr. Pjetri, a person of African descent, was born in Kosovo and has been living in Switzerland since 1994. He has been trying to obtain Swiss citizenship since 1998, but his applications have been repeatedly rejected. The petitioner has a physical disability and has been receiving disability benefits since 1998. He has been integrated into the local community, having attended German language schools and having a list of 300 signatures from inhabitants of the village confirming his proficiency in the language and his good integration. Despite this, his applications for naturalization have been rejected, and he has been subjected to considerable hostilities, racist remarks, and acts of violence. The petitioner claims that the Supreme Court did not sufficiently examine the grounds on which the decision of the municipal assembly rejecting his application was based, which constituted discrimination on the grounds of his origin.

Procedural History:

The case was brought before the United Nations Human Rights Committee. The petitioner, Mr. Pjetri, alleged that his rights under articles 2, 14, and 26 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights were violated when his application for naturalization was rejected by the municipal assembly. The Committee noted that the author has exhausted domestic remedies and that his claims are not manifestly ill-founded.

Legal Analysis and Reasoning:

The Committee considered the petitioner's claims of discrimination on the grounds of his origin and disability. The Committee found that the petitioner has sufficiently substantiated his claims of discrimination on the grounds of his origin and disability. The Committee noted that the standards for integration applied by the lower tribunals were too onerous and discriminatory given the petitioner's disability and the hostility he faced. The Committee concluded that the petitioner's rights under articles 2, 14, and 26 of the Covenant have been violated.

Decisions and Rulings:

The Committee requested the State party, Switzerland, to guarantee the petitioner a nondiscriminatory and fair naturalization procedure, provide him with compensation for the damages suffered, cover the costs of the present proceedings, and adapt its national legal system so that a victim of a violation of the Convention can submit a complaint to the Supreme Court.

Impact and Significance:

This case highlights the issue of discrimination against individuals with disabilities and those from certain ethnic origins in the context of naturalization processes. The decision of the United Nations Human Rights Committee sets a precedent for future cases of alleged discrimination in naturalization processes. It emphasizes the importance of ensuring fair and non-discriminatory naturalization procedures and the need to protect the rights of individuals with disabilities.
