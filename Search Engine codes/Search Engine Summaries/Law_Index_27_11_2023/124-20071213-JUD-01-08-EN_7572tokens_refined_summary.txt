Title: Territorial and Maritime Dispute (Nicaragua v. Colombia)

Case Overview:
The case involves a territorial and maritime dispute between Nicaragua and Colombia. Nicaragua filed an application in 2001, initiating proceedings against Colombia regarding a group of related legal issues concerning territory and maritime delimitation. Colombia raised preliminary objections to the court's jurisdiction, leading to the suspension of proceedings on the merits.

Important Details:
- Colombia raised a preliminary objection to the court's jurisdiction based on Article VI of the Pact of Bogot.
- Judge Bennouna dissented from the court's decision to uphold the objection, arguing that the court should have examined the merits of the case.

- The International Law Commission justifies the absolute invalidity of treaties procured by coercion to ensure the victim can determine its future relations freely.
- The court failed to adequately address Nicaragua's arguments regarding the invalidity of the 1928 Treaty.
- The ICJ considered two preliminary objections raised by Colombia regarding the court's jurisdiction.
- The first objection concerned the validity of the 1928 Treaty, which the court ruled should be examined in the merits phase.
- The second objection related to Colombia's argument that the ICJ lacked authority to hear the case.
