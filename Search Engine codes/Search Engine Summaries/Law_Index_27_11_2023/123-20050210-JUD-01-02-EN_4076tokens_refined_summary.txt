Title: Certain Property (Liechtenstein v. Germany)

Case Overview:
This case, numbered 123 in the International Court of Justice, involves a dispute between Liechtenstein and Germany regarding the confiscation of Liechtenstein property in Germany after World War II. The critical date in the case is 1980 when the Settlement Convention entered into force. The Court is tasked with determining the scope of its jurisdiction ratione temporis and interpreting the European Convention on Human Rights in relation to the case.

Important Details:
- The Court is considering whether the German courts' decisions of the 1990s, which triggered the dispute, are the real cause of the dispute or if the real cause is the confiscation of property that occurred before the critical date.
- The Court is examining the broader language in the exclusion ratione temporis and applying the "real cause" test to determine the correct interpretation of the European Convention.
- The German courts' decisions were based on the Settlement Convention, which deals only with German external assets, and Liechtenstein argues that it is not bound by its provisions as a third party.
- The dispute solely relates to the propriety of the German courts' decisions and not the lawfulness of the confiscation of Liechtenstein property in Czechoslovakia.
- The Court has admitted that no pre-1980 conduct attributable to Germany was raised in the proceedings, and a "new situation" exists where earlier case law under the Settlement Convention is applied for the first time to neutral and non-German property.
- The Respondent (Germany) is not responsible for the Benes Decrees but may have undertaken post-critical date acts that potentially engaged its international responsibility.
