Title: Whaling in the Antarctic (Australia v. Japan: New Zealand intervening)

Case Overview:
In May 2010, Australia initiated legal proceedings against Japan for its large-scale whaling program in the Antarctic, known as JARPA II. Australia argued that Japan's actions violated its obligations under the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling (ICRW) and other international obligations related to marine mammal preservation and the marine environment.

Document Overview:
This document, dated March 14, 2014, is an order issued by Judge Giorgio Gaja in the International Court of Justice case number 148. It specifically focuses on paragraphs 41-43 of the document. Judge Gaja raises concerns about the Court's failure to properly analyze the conditions for the admissibility of New Zealand's intervention in the case. He also highlights a potential misinterpretation of the Statute regarding the binding nature of the convention.

Important Details:
- Judge Gaja asserts that the Court should have provided clarification on certain aspects of the intervention procedure under Article 63 of the Statute.
- The Court did not adequately analyze the conditions for the admissibility of New Zealand's intervention.
- The Court included remarks that were not relevant to the admissibility of the intervention.
- Judge Gaja emphasizes that the provision in the Statute, stating that the construction of the convention will be equally binding upon the intervener, should not be interpreted to mean that only the intervener will be bound.
- The provision suggests that the parties involved in the case will also be bound towards the intervener, and the intervener will be bound towards the parties.
- The Court's focus on the future obligations of the intervener may indicate a different interpretation.
