Title: Arrest Warrant of 11 April 2000 (Democratic Republic of the Congo v. Belgium)

Case Overview:
The case involves a dispute between the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and Belgium over an international arrest warrant issued against the Congolese Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr. Abdoulaye Yerodia Ndombasi. The DRC argues that the arrest warrant and Belgium's law on serious violations of international humanitarian law violate international law. The DRC requests provisional measures to prevent the execution of the warrant and protect its rights.

Important Details:
- The DRC argues that the international arrest warrant issued by Belgium against Mr. Ndombasi is invalid and contravenes the principle of non-retroactivity, as well as the principles of immunity and inviolability of foreign heads of state and ministers.
- Belgium argues that the change in circumstances following a cabinet reshuffle in the DRC, which led to Mr. Ndombasi ceasing to exercise the functions of Minister for Foreign Affairs, undermines any claim to irreparable prejudice and urgency.
- The DRC requests the International Court of Justice (ICJ) to order Belgium to cease and desist from any conduct that might exacerbate the dispute and to discharge the international arrest warrant issued against Mr. Ndombasi.
- Belgium requests the ICJ to remove the case from its List.
- The legal basis for the DRC's application is Article 75, paragraphs 1 and 2, of the Rules of Court, as well as the optional declarations recognizing the Court's jurisdiction made by both Belgium and the DRC.
- The DRC filed the application on 17 October 2000, disputing the arrest warrant issued on 11 April 2000.
- The case is being heard by the ICJ, with Judge Keith as the presiding judge.
