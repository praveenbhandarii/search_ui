Title: Territorial and Maritime Dispute (Nicaragua v. Colombia)

Case Overview:
The case involves a territorial and maritime dispute between Nicaragua and Colombia. Nicaragua filed an application in 2001, initiating proceedings against Colombia regarding legal issues related to territory and maritime delimitation. Colombia filed preliminary objections to jurisdiction, leading to the suspension of the proceedings on the merits.

Important Details:
- The International Court of Justice (ICJ) has the power to permit a non-party State to intervene in a proceeding if it can demonstrate an interest of a legal nature that may be affected by the decision.
- The ICJ distinguishes between "established rights" and "interests of a legal nature" in its jurisprudence.
- An interest of a legal nature is a real and concrete claim based on law, as opposed to an established right.
- The ICJ's practice of not elaborating on the expression "an interest of a legal nature" is due to the nature of the power it exercises under Article 62.
- The distinction between an established right and an interest of a legal nature is problematic, and the ICJ's definition of the latter does not necessarily differentiate it from an established right.
- States have requested permission to intervene in ICJ cases to protect their legal rights and interests.
- The ICJ applies a flexible approach to defining an interest of a legal nature, considering the specific context and circumstances of each case.
