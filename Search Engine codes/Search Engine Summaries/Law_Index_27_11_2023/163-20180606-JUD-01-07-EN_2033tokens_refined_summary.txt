Title: Immunities and Criminal Proceedings (Equatorial Guinea v. France)

Case Overview:
The Republic of Equatorial Guinea initiated proceedings against the French Republic regarding the immunity from criminal jurisdiction of the Second Vice-President of Equatorial Guinea, Mr. Teodoro Nguema Obiang Mangue, and the legal status of the Embassy of Equatorial Guinea in France.

Document Overview:
This judgment document, dated 19 February 2020, provides the separate opinion of Judge Gevorgian on the preliminary objections raised in the case. The judges involved in the case include Judge ad hoc Gevorgian, Judge Canado Trindade, Judge Donoghue, Judge Gaja, Judge Keith, Judge Bennouna, and Judge Xue.

Important Details:
- Judge Gevorgian's separate opinion supports the Court's conclusion that it lacks jurisdiction under the Palermo Convention to hear the dispute between Equatorial Guinea and France.
- The central question in the case is whether the immunities of States and State officials can be invoked before the Court.
- The Court determined that Article 4 of the Palermo Convention, which refers to the principle of sovereign equality, does not incorporate customary international rules on immunities of States and State officials.
- The Court found that it lacks jurisdiction over the aspect of the dispute concerning the immunity of the Vice-President of Equatorial Guinea and the immunity claimed for the building housing the Embassy of Equatorial Guinea in Paris.
- The Court affirmed that further determinations regarding the obligations of States parties under Article 4 of the Palermo Convention are unnecessary.
- Judge Gevorgian provides clarification on certain elements of the Court's reasoning, including the interpretation of Article 4 of the Palermo Convention and the scope of the Court's jurisdiction.

Additional Information:
- The case of Democratic Republic of the Congo v. Belgium is referenced, where the ICJ determined that holders of high-ranking office in a State enjoy immunities from jurisdiction in other States, both civil and criminal.
- Compliance with this obligation is independent of the Court's lack of jurisdiction under Article 4 of the Palermo Convention.
- The importance of immunities in the relations between States parties to the Palermo Convention is emphasized.
- The Arrest Warrant in the Democratic Republic of the Congo v. Belgium case was issued on 11 April 2000, and the judgment was delivered on 20 February 2002.
