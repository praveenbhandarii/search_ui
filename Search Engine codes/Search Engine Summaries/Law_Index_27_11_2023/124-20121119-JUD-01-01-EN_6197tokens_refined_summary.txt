Title: Territorial and Maritime Dispute (Nicaragua v. Colombia)

Case Overview:
The case involves a territorial and maritime dispute between Nicaragua and Colombia. Nicaragua initially filed an application in 2001, claiming that Colombia violated its sovereignty over maritime areas. The dispute revolves around the delimitation of maritime boundaries, specifically regarding the continental shelf and exclusive economic zone. Colombia objected to Nicaragua's revised claim, arguing it constituted a radical change in the subject matter of the dispute. The International Court of Justice (ICJ) had to determine the admissibility of the new claim.
