Title: Maritime Delimitation in the Indian Ocean (Somalia v. Kenya)

Case Overview:
This case involves a dispute between Somalia and Kenya regarding the delimitation of their maritime boundaries in the Indian Ocean. Somalia filed an Application with the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in 2014, seeking the determination of the complete course of the single maritime boundary dividing the maritime areas of both countries, including the continental shelf beyond 200 nautical miles.

Important Details:
- The dispute centers around the interpretation of a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between Somalia and Kenya regarding maritime delimitation in the Indian Ocean.
- Kenya argues that the MOU provides for a method of settlement for maritime delimitation disputes, which excludes the jurisdiction of the ICJ.
- Somalia contends that the MOU does not provide for an alternative method of settlement and that the ICJ has jurisdiction over the dispute.
- The ICJ is asked to interpret the MOU, determine its own jurisdiction, and establish the complete course of the maritime boundary between Somalia and Kenya.
- The Court's interpretation of the MOU focuses on the entire document rather than individual paragraphs, finding that the parties have agreed to delimit their continental shelf definitively through an agreement once the Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf (CLCS) has made its recommendations.
- The Court concludes that the MOU does not contain a dispute settlement procedure or time constraints.
- The judgment is based on Article 31 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties and the general rule of interpretation.
- The case involves the interpretation of international law, including the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) and the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties.

Document Details:
This judgment, issued by the ICJ on March 20, 2018, dismisses Kenya's preliminary objection in the dispute with Somalia over their maritime boundary. The judgment is written by Judge Mohamed Bennouna. The MOU between the parties establishes a method of settlement for the dispute, but the ICJ finds it incompatible with the ordinary meaning of the treaty provision. Kenya's reservation to the declaration recognizing the jurisdiction of the Court is deemed valid as the MOU does not provide a different method of settlement from that specified in Article 83, paragraph 1, of UNCLOS.

Additional Information:
The document highlights the potential risks of international courts failing to respect the consent of the states involved, which may lead to issues during the implementation of the judgment. It notes that the sixth paragraph of the MOU is not mentioned in the text, and draws a conclusion from this silence. The document is signed by Judge Mohamed Bennouna.
