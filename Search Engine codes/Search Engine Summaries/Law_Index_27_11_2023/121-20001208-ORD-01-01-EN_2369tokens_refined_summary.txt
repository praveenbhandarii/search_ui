Title: Arrest Warrant of 11 April 2000 (Democratic Republic of the Congo v. Belgium)

Case Overview:
The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) filed a case against Belgium regarding an international arrest warrant issued against the acting Congolese Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr. Abdoulaye Yerodia Ndombasi. The DRC sought to challenge the warrant and subsequent extradition to Belgium for alleged crimes constituting "grave violations of international humanitarian law."

Important Details:
- The International Court of Justice (ICJ) dismissed the DRC's request for provisional measures against Belgium.
- Judge Oda disagreed with the decision but voted in favor of paragraph 78(1) of the Court's Order out of judicial solidarity.
- The DRC's Application was deemed moot due to Mr. Yerodia Ndombasi's presence at the UN General Assembly.
- The ICJ did not provide sufficient explanation for its conclusion that the DRC's Application has not become moot.
- Belgium suggested that the Court indicate provisional measures to address the difficulties caused by the issuance of the arrest warrant in a manner consistent with their obligations under international law.
- The Congo did not indicate a basis of jurisdiction for the case in its Application but later argued that the ICJ has jurisdiction based on the optional clause (Article 36, paragraph 2 of the Court's Statute).
- The ICJ is being asked to remove the case from its List.
- Judge Oda has doubts about the haste to reach a conclusion on the interpretation of certain general principles of international law.
- The case concerns a dispute between the Congo and Belgium regarding the arrest of the Congo's Foreign Minister, Mr. Yerodia Ndombasi, pursuant to a warrant issued by a Belgian judge.
- The Congo based its jurisdiction on Article 36, paragraph 2, of the Court's Statute and the 1961 Optional Protocol concerning the Compulsory Settlement of Disputes.
- The Court held that there was no legal dispute between the Congo and Belgium and therefore no jurisdiction for the Court to hear the case.
- The judgment was delivered on December 19, 2000, and the Court's Order was issued on the same day.

Document Details:
This document is an order issued by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in Case Number 121, titled "Arrest Warrant of 11 April 2000 (Democratic Republic of the Congo v. Belgium)." The document discusses the legal principles of international law concerning the exercise of state jurisdiction. The judges who heard the case were Vice-President Sir Muhammad Zamir, President; Judge Hiroshi Asada, Judge; and Judge Bernard Simmat, Judge. The document also includes the Court's file number, CR 2000/134, and the author is Shigeru ODA.

Additional Information:
The document raises the concern that if the Court waits until the jurisdictional phase to address the issue of whether a State may be compulsorily brought to the Court in consequence of its voluntary acceptance of the Court's jurisdiction, it could lead to an excessive number of similar cases and potentially cause States to withdraw their acceptance of the Court's compulsory jurisdiction.
