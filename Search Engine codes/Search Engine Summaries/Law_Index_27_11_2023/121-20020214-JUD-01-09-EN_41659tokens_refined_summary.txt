Title: Arrest Warrant of 11 April 2000 (Democratic Republic of the Congo v. Belgium)

Case Overview:
The case involves a dispute between the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and Belgium regarding an international arrest warrant issued against the acting Congolese Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr. Abdoulaye Yerodia Ndombasi. The DRC filed an application with the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in 2000, alleging that Belgium violated international humanitarian law. The ICJ was asked to determine whether Belgium had violated customary international law by issuing and circulating the arrest warrant despite Mr. Yerodia's immunity as a Foreign Minister.

Important Details:
- The arrest warrant was issued by Belgium on 11 April 2000 against Mr. Yerodia for alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity.
- The warrant was not enforced when Mr. Yerodia visited Belgium in 2000, as he was still in office. However, Belgium requested an Interpol Red Notice for him in 2001 after he had ceased to be a Minister.
- The ICJ delivered its judgment on 14 December 2007, ruling that Belgium had not violated international law by issuing and circulating the arrest warrant.
- The Court found that Mr. Yerodia's immunity as a Foreign Minister did not extend to charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity. The warrant was based on these charges, and Mr. Yerodia had ceased to be a Minister at the time it was issued.
- The judgment focused on the question of immunity from jurisdiction and did not address the issue of (universal) jurisdiction.
- The ICJ considered the balance between international accountability for war crimes and crimes against humanity and the principle of sovereign equality of States.

Document Details:
This judgment, issued by the ICJ on 14 December 2007, is related to the case number ICC01/04-01/05. The judges involved in the case were Judge van Den Wyngaert (Presiding Judge), Judge Puis, Judge Robinson, Judge Sicre, Judge Ad Hoc Fremr, and Judge Ad Hoc Merty. The document provides key information about the case, including the key players, key documents, key dates, key facts, and key issues.

Additional Information:
- The case was brought under the ICJ's jurisdiction pursuant to the Convention on the Immunities of States and their Property (1973).
- The case involved issues of customary international law, international comity, and the exercise of universal jurisdiction by States.
- The ICJ's ruling in this case has implications for other cases involving foreign officials accused of international crimes, as it may set a precedent for granting immunity to such individuals.
- The ICJ acknowledged that granting immunities to incumbent Foreign Ministers may increase the number of persons with international immunity from jurisdiction, but it is not necessarily a bad thing as it may be necessary for the proper functioning of international relations.
