- Case Summary: The Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination declared a petition inadmissible that alleged discrimination against Muslims in Denmark, as the petition exclusively related to discrimination on religious grounds and the Convention does not cover discrimination based on religion alone.

Procedural History:

- The petitioner alleges that he has been subjected to discrimination based on his Muslim religion and that the impugned statements specifically refer to the Koran, to Islam and to Muslims in general, without any reference to any race, colour, descent, or national or ethnic origin.
- The Committee observes that the Muslims currently living in the State party are of heterogeneous origin and consists of non-citizens and Danish citizens, including Danish converts.
- The Committee recognizes the importance of the interface between race and religion and considers that it would be competent to consider a claim of double discrimination on the basis of religion and another ground specifically provided for in article 1 of the Convention.
- However, the Committee declares the petition inadmissible ratione materiae under article 14, paragraph 1, of the Convention, as the petition exclusively relates to discrimination on religious grounds and the Convention does not cover discrimination based on religion alone.

Legal Analysis and Reasoning:

- The Committee's decision highlights the importance of considering the interface between race and religion in cases of alleged discrimination.
- While the Convention does not cover discrimination based on religion alone, the Committee recognized that it would be competent to consider a claim of double discrimination on the basis of religion and another ground specifically provided for in article 1 of the Convention.
- However, in this case, the petition was declared inadmissible as it exclusively related to discrimination on religious grounds.

Decisions and Rulings:
