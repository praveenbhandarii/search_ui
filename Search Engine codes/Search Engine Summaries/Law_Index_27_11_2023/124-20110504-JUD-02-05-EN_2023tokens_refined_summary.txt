Title: Territorial and Maritime Dispute (Nicaragua v. Colombia)

Case Overview:
The case (Number 124) before the International Court of Justice involves a territorial and maritime dispute between Nicaragua and Colombia. Nicaragua filed an Application in 2001, seeking resolution of legal issues related to territory and maritime delimitation. Colombia subsequently raised preliminary objections to jurisdiction, leading to a suspension of the proceedings on the merits.

Important Details:
- Costa Rica has applied to intervene in the case to protect its own interests, as the area claimed by Costa Rica overlaps with the disputed area.
- The Court's practice in delimitation cases involving overlapping claims is to use directional arrows to avoid delimiting boundaries in areas where the rights of a third state may be affected.
- Costa Rica has an agreed maritime boundary with Colombia and Panama but lacks such a boundary with Nicaragua.
- Costa Rica has defined a minimum area of interest vis-Ã -vis Nicaragua.
- The Court does not clearly state whether the overlap of Costa Rica's claim with the area at issue gives rise to an interest of a legal nature.
- Judge Donoghue disagrees with the Court's approach to Article 62 of the Statute of the Court and believes that Costa Rica's application to intervene should be granted.
- The Court typically affixes a directional arrow at the end of the boundary line to indicate that the prolongation of the boundary line established by its decision extends only until it reaches the area where the rights or claims of a third State may be affected.
- Costa Rica has demonstrated that it has an interest of a legal nature that may be affected by the Judgment in this case.
- The Court should have granted Costa Rica's Application for permission to intervene.
- The Court's current practice in intervention cases appears to invite third States to apply to intervene as a means to present their views to the Court, whether or not the Application is granted.
- The case is related to a border dispute between Nicaragua and Honduras.
- The dissenting opinion, written by Judge Joan E. Donoghue, was filed on June 13, 2013, and the case is identified by the abbreviation "CIJ1019" (case number).

Additional Information:
The parties in the case had differing attitudes towards the proposed intervention, with Nicaragua opposing intervention and expressing concerns about procedural consequences. Judge Donoghue acknowledges Nicaragua's concerns but believes that Costa Rica has met its burden under Article 62. The Court granted the Application, as it did in a previous case involving a third State with overlapping claims (Land and Maritime Boundary between Cameroon and Nigeria).
