Title: Territorial and Maritime Dispute (Nicaragua v. Colombia)

Case Overview:
The case involves a territorial and maritime dispute between Nicaragua and Colombia. Nicaragua filed an application in 2001, initiating proceedings against Colombia regarding title to territory and maritime delimitation. Colombia filed preliminary objections to jurisdiction, leading to the suspension of the proceedings on the merits. The case raises concerns about the potential impact on Costa Rica's interests due to its 1977 bilateral treaty with Colombia.

Important Details:
- Costa Rica's application to intervene in the case between Nicaragua and Colombia was rejected by the International Court of Justice (ICJ). The court found that Costa Rica's interest of a legal nature would not be affected by the judgment.
- The ICJ's decision was based on Article 62 of the ICJ Statute, which sets out the necessary and sufficient conditions for a third state to intervene. Judge Abraham dissented, arguing that intervention by a third state is a right, not subject to the court's discretion.
- The court's position on intervention in this case is more restrictive than its previous jurisprudence, as seen in the decision on Equatorial Guinea's request to intervene in the Cameroon-Nigeria case.
- The 1977 bilateral treaty between Costa Rica and Colombia regarding maritime delimitation, which has not entered into force, may be called into question if Nicaragua's claims are upheld, potentially prejudicing Costa Rica's interests.

Document Details:
This judgment document of the International Court of Justice, dated 13 June 2013, discusses Costa Rica's application to intervene in the territorial and maritime dispute case between Nicaragua and Colombia. The judges presiding over the case were Abraham (President), Onyechi Collins (Vice President), and Gevorgian (Judge). The court rejected Costa Rica's application, finding that its legal interests would not be affected by the court's judgment.

Additional Information:
The court's reasoning in refusing Costa Rica's request to intervene is criticized for being restrictive and potentially rendering the intervention procedure meaningless. The judge questions the necessity of the intervention procedure if the court is wise enough to consider the interests of third parties without intervention. Doubts are expressed about whether the court intended to go as far as its literal reasoning in this case.
