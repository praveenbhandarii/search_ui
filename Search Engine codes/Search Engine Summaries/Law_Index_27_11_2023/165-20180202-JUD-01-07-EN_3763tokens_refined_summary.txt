Title: Land Boundary in the Northern Part of Isla Portillos (Costa Rica v. Nicaragua)

Case Overview:
This case, numbered 165, involves a dispute between Costa Rica and Nicaragua regarding the precise definition of the boundary in the area of Los Portillos/Harbor Head Lagoon and the establishment of a new military camp by Nicaragua on the beach of Isla Portillos. Costa Rica filed an Application instituting proceedings against Nicaragua on 16 January 2017.

Important Details:
- The dispute concerns the land boundary between Costa Rica and Nicaragua on the Atlantic side, specifically at Punta de Castilla and the San Juan de Nicaragua River.
- General Alexander fixed the starting point of the land boundary at Punta de Castilla in 1897, and the boundary line turns southeastward along the waters edge around the harbor until it reaches the river proper.
- There is a dispute about the existence of a water channel connecting the river and Harbor Head Lagoon.
- The majority of the Court-appointed experts dismissed the evidence of a channel-like water gap, while the dissenting opinion argues that the elongated but discontinuous lagoons running parallel to the Caribbean shore were what the experts referred to.
- The dissenting opinion argues that the boundary between the Parties is the starting point of General Alexander, and that the majority's conclusion does not lead to the conclusion that the shore abutting the Caribbean and the partly dried channel is under Costa Rican sovereignty.
- The ICJ determined that the territory under Costa Rica's sovereignty extends to the right bank of the Lower San Juan River as far as its mouth in the Caribbean Sea.
- The ICJ also determined that the Harbor Head Lagoon and the sandbar separating it from the Caribbean Sea are under Nicaraguan sovereignty.
- Costa Rica has sovereignty over the whole northern part of Isla Portillos, including its coast.
- Nicaragua is required to remove its military camp from Costa Rican territory.
