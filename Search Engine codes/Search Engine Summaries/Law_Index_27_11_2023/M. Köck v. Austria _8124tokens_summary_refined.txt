- Court/Tribunal: United Nations Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities
- Document Details: Adopted by the Committee at its 26th session (725 March 2022)
- Key Parties Involved: M. Kck (author) and Austria (State party)
- Case Name: M. Kck v. Austria

Case Summary:
The author, a deaf person, was forced to be educated in German, without access to instruction in Austrian Sign Language. The Committee finds that the State party violated the author's rights under the Convention, particularly the right to education in the author's first language.

Procedural History:
- The author filed three applications for arbitration concerning her school performance between October 2012 and February 2013.
- The first proceedings resulted in an agreement to increase interpretation and provide professional interpreters for oral examinations, visual teaching material for mathematics, and a curriculum change.
- The second proceedings ended without an agreement, as recognition of Austrian Sign Language in school legislation could only be achieved by legislative change.
- The third proceedings resulted in the Regional School Board for Carinthia agreeing to bear the costs of sign language interpretation.

Legal Analysis and Reasoning:
- The Committee interprets article 5 of the Convention as requiring the State party to ensure the author's equal access to education, including in Austrian Sign Language.
- The Committee finds that the State party's failure to provide the author with inclusive education in Austrian Sign Language amounts to discrimination, in violation of article 5 of the Convention.
- The Committee also finds that the State party's legislation and lack of curriculum for bilingual education have resulted in unequal treatment of the author, in breach of article 5 of the Convention.

Decisions and Rulings:
- The Committee finds that the State party has violated the author's rights under articles 5, 7, 12(3)(4), 13(1), 21(b) and (e), 24 and 30(4) of the Convention.
- The Committee declares the communication admissible and requests the State party to provide the author with an effective remedy, including compensation and measures to prevent similar violations in the future.

Impact and Significance:
- This case highlights the importance of ensuring equal access to education for persons with disabilities, particularly those who are deaf or hard of hearing.
- The decision reinforces the obligation of States to provide inclusive education and to ensure that legislation and policies are in place to support this goal.
- The case also underscores the need for States to consider the best interests of the child and to ensure that their rights are protected and respected.
