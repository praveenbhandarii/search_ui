Title: Case Number 150 - Provisional Measures, Order of 18 July 2011 (Cambodia v. Thailand)

Overview:
This document pertains to a ongoing dispute between Costa Rica and Nicaragua over the construction of two new canals in an environmentally protected area along the San Juan River. The International Court of Justice (ICJ) has issued provisional measures to regulate Costa Rica's access to the disputed territory and the use of the San Juan River.

Important Details:
- Judge ad hoc Dugard supports the Order and the measures contained within it.
- Judge Dugard believes that the Order did not address Costa Rica's access to the disputed territory via the San Juan River.
- Nicaragua claims absolute sovereignty over the San Juan River, while Costa Rica argues that it needs access to the river to reach the new canals.
- The Court should have regulated Costa Rica's access to the new canals, including the use of the San Juan River, in its Order.
- The Dispute regarding Navigational Rights decision may not impose an absolute prohibition on Costa Rica's right to navigate the San Juan River for purposes other than commerce.
- The protection of the environment should be considered when interpreting the legal regime governing navigation on the San Juan River.
- Nicaragua's regulation of navigation on the river must not be unreasonable and must not excessively impact Costa Rica's right to freedom of navigation.
- The ICJ ordered Nicaragua to prevent Costa Rica from using the San Juan River to access the new canals for remediation work, as Nicaragua's construction of the canals in an environmentally protected area is illegal.
- Nicaragua's power to regulate Costa Rica's right to freedom of navigation under the 1858 Treaty of Limits is not unlimited and must be balanced with the rights and obligations of both parties.
- Nicaragua is not ordered to obstruct Costa Rica's free access to the new canals, but it must refrain from obstructing Costa Rica's access to the disputed territory.
- The method of how Costa Rica will gain access to the disputed territory remains unresolved, and Costa Rica must provide prior notice to Nicaragua before taking any measures to prevent harm to the environment.
- Both parties prioritize the protection of the environment in the disputed territory during any remediation works on the new canals.
- The case is ongoing, and the ICJ has not yet issued a final ruling.

Additional Information:
- The document is a provisional measure order issued on 18 July 2011 in the case between Cambodia and Thailand regarding the interpretation of the judgment of 15 June 1962 concerning the Temple of Preah Vihear.
