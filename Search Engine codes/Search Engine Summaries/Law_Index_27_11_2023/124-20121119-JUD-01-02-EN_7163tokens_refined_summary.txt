Title: Territorial and Maritime Dispute (Nicaragua v. Colombia)

Case Overview:
This case, numbered 124, involves a territorial and maritime dispute between Nicaragua and Colombia. The dispute centers around the sovereignty over several islands in the Caribbean Sea. Nicaragua filed an application in 2001, and Colombia raised preliminary objections to jurisdiction in 2003, leading to the suspension of proceedings on the merits.

Important Details:
- The case involves a dispute between Nicaragua and Colombia regarding the sovereignty of several maritime features, including the Archipelago, Alburquerque Cays, EastSoutheast Cays, Quitasueo, Serrana, Roncador, Serranilla, and Bajo Nuevo.
- The 1928 Treaty between Colombia and Nicaragua is relevant to the dispute.
- The International Court of Justice (ICJ) determined that the 1928 Treaty did not settle the question of sovereignty over the disputed features and that the Court had jurisdiction to decide the matter.
- The Court found that the Treaty is unclear on the point of sovereignty, and the Parties have different interpretations of its meaning and scope.
- In a separate opinion, Judge Abraham held that the 1928 Treaty accords Colombia sovereignty over San Andrs, Providencia, and Santa Catalina, but does not accord either party sovereignty over the other maritime features in dispute.
- The ICJ employed a three-stage process to delimit the maritime boundary, constructing a provisional median line that was criticized for ignoring the majority of Colombia's relevant coasts.
- The Court acknowledged the difficulties in constructing a median line due to overlapping entitlements within the exclusive economic zone and ultimately constructed two horizontal lines along lines of latitude to delimit the area to the east of the Colombian islands.
- The judgment was written by Judge Ronny Abraham, who emphasized the court's departure from its usual technique to maintain clarity and intelligibility.

Document Details:
This judgment, dated July 1, 2014, is part of the ICJ Reports and was written by Judge Ronny Abraham. It provides a detailed analysis of the territorial and maritime dispute between Nicaragua and Colombia, the interpretation of the 1928 Treaty, and the Court's decision to construct a provisional median line for delimitation.

Additional Information:
The case has important implications for the delimitation of maritime boundaries in similar cases. The Court's approach in departing from its usual technique to maintain clarity and intelligibility was deemed necessary by Judge Abraham.
