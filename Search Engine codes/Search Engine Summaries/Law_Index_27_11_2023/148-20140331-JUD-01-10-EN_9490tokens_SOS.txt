Title: Whaling in the Antarctic (Australia v. Japan: New Zealand intervening)

Case Overview:
This case involves Australia's claim against Japan regarding its large-scale whaling program, JARPA II, which Australia argues is in violation of international obligations for the preservation of marine mammals and the marine environment. Australia brought the case before the International Court of Justice (ICJ) seeking a declaration that Japan's whaling activities in the Antarctic breach the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling (ICRW).

The document provides details about Japan's non-compliance with the IWC's Schedule, the violation of its duty to cooperate with the IWC and its Scientific Committee, and the failure to provide evidence of international scientific cooperation. The dissenting opinion of Judge Bhandari is also mentioned. The document is authored by Judge Oda and includes separate concurring opinions from Judge Bhandari and Judge Keith. It is important to note that the document is dated May 15, 2015.

Important Details:
