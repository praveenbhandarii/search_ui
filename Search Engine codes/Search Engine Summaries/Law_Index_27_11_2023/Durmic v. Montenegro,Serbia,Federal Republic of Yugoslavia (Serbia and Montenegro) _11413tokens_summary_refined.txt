Procedural History:

- The petitioner filed a criminal complaint with the Public Prosecutors Office in Belgrade on July 21, 2000, alleging a violation of his rights as well as the rights of other Roma individuals to equality, human dignity, and equal access to public places.
- The Public Prosecutor requested the police to investigate the incident, but they failed to do so.
- The petitioner filed a petition in the Federal Constitutional Court, stating that the Public Prosecutor's failure to identify the perpetrators and dismissal of the criminal complaint prevented the petitioner and alleged victim from taking over the prosecution of the case on their own behalf.
- The petitioner submitted a complaint to the Human Rights Committee alleging racial discrimination by the State party.
- The State party requested the Committee to reconsider its decision on admissibility, but the Committee found no reason to do so.

Legal Analysis and Reasoning:

- The case highlights the issue of discrimination against the Roma community in Serbia and Montenegro and the lack of effective remedies available to victims of discrimination.
- The petitioner's argument that the exhaustion of domestic remedies is not required, as the available remedies are not effective in addressing the discrimination, is supported by previous decisions of the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination.
- The Committee found that the State party had failed to conduct a comprehensive, prompt, and ultimately effective official investigation into the incident.
- The Committee rejected the State party's argument that criminal remedies were inadequate for addressing non-pecuniary harm and that civil and administrative remedies alone were not sufficient.
- The Committee invoked its previous decisions in Habassi v. Denmark and Kashif Ahmad v. Denmark, which established that article 4 of the Convention requires States parties to ensure that their domestic laws and regulations provide adequate protection against racial discrimination.

Decisions and Rulings:

- The Committee found that the respondent had violated the petitioner's rights under the International Convention on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination.
- The Committee found that the respondent had failed to provide an effective remedy for the petitioner's complaint, and that the petitioner had exhausted all domestic remedies available.
- The Committee also found that the respondent had violated article 14 of the Convention, which provides for the right to an effective remedy.
- The Committee recommends that the State party provide the petitioner with just and adequate compensation and take measures to ensure proper investigation of accusations and complaints related to acts of racial discrimination.

Impact and Significance:

- The case is significant in highlighting the ongoing struggles faced by the Roma community in Serbia and Montenegro and the need for effective measures to address discrimination and ensure equal enjoyment of human rights.
- The case has implications for the protection of the rights of minority groups and the responsibility of states to provide effective remedies for victims of discrimination.
- The decision emphasizes that States parties have an obligation under article 4 of the Convention to ensure that their domestic laws and regulations provide adequate protection against racial discrimination.
