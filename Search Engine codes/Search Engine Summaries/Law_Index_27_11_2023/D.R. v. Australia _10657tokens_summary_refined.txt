- Document Details: Communication No. 46/2008, 1 June 2008

Legal Analysis and Reasoning:
The case raises issues related to discrimination on the ground of national origin and the rights of non-citizens in Australia. The State party's response relies on the fact that the author is not a permanent resident or citizen of Australia, but the author argues that this is not a sufficient justification for the discrimination he faces. The Committee analyzed the relevant laws and found that the State party's laws and regulations discriminate against the petitioner based on his national origin and impose unequal treatment between Australian citizens and legal residents. The Committee also concluded that Australia's restriction on access to social security, education, and nationality for non-Australian residents without a permanent visa is not justified and violates Article 2(1)(a) of the Convention.

Decisions and Rulings:
The Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination finds that Australia has violated the petitioner's rights to non-discrimination based on national origin, social security, education, and nationality under the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. The Committee notes that Australia's laws and regulations discriminate against the petitioner based on his national origin and impose unequal treatment between Australian citizens and legal residents. The Committee also finds that Australia's restriction on access to social security, education, and nationality for non-Australian residents without a permanent visa is not justified and violates Article 2(1)(a) of the Convention.

Impact and Significance:
The case highlights the issue of discrimination based on national origin in Australia's immigration policies and laws. It has implications for the rights of non-Australian residents in Australia, particularly those who are not refugees, to access social security, education, and nationality. The case also underscores the importance of effective protection and remedies for victims of discrimination under international human rights law.
