Important Details:
- Maritime delimitation involves balancing the certainty and predictability of the law with the realities of geography.
- Judges are allowed to modify nature to some extent, as long as it is not complete or blatant.
- The weight given to a particular island in delimitation is subjective.
- The drawing of an equidistance line for delimitation cannot be solely based on mathematical calculations.
- The Court should assess the equity of delimitation holistically, considering more than just gross disproportionality at the third stage of delimitation.
- The third stage of delimitation is tied to the objective yardstick of the length of the Parties' relevant coasts.
- The self-imposed reduction of an equitable solution is not supported by Articles 74 and 83 of the Law of the Sea Convention.
- A more equitable outcome could have been achieved by giving considerable, but not complete, effect to the Nicoya Peninsula in delimitation of the exclusive economic zone and the continental shelf.
- The declaration emphasizes the subjective nature of maritime delimitation and the importance of considering geographical realities in the process.
