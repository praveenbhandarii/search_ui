Title: Arrest Warrant of 11 April 2000 (Democratic Republic of the Congo v. Belgium)

Case Overview:
The case involves a dispute between the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and Belgium regarding an international arrest warrant issued by Belgium against the acting Congolese Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr. Abdoulaye Yerodia Ndombasi. The DRC argues that the arrest warrant violates international law, including principles of state sovereignty, sovereign equality, and diplomatic immunity. Belgium objects to the jurisdiction and admissibility of the case. The arrest warrant is based on allegations of inciting racial hatred, resulting in several hundred deaths, internment, summary executions, arbitrary arrests, and unfair trials, which the DRC claims constitute grave violations of international humanitarian law.

Important Details:
- The DRC filed an application against Belgium on 17 October 2000, contesting the arrest warrant issued on 11 April 2000.
- Belgium requested the International Court of Justice (ICJ) to declare that it lacks jurisdiction or that the DRC's application is inadmissible.
- The case involves issues of jurisdiction, admissibility, and the applicability of diplomatic immunity.
- The ICJ rejected Belgium's request to remove the case from the list and held that the Court has jurisdiction over the matter.
- The ICJ found that the arrest warrant violated the immunity of the incumbent Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Congo and infringed his immunity from criminal jurisdiction and inviolability under international law.
- The ICJ declared that Belgium must cancel the arrest warrant and inform the authorities to whom it was circulated.
- The ICJ considered that reparation must, as far as possible, wipe out all the consequences of the illegal act and reestablish the situation which would have existed if that act had not been committed.
- The ICJ's decision was based on the violation of the Congo's sovereignty and the arrest warrant being issued without sufficient evidence.
- The case was decided on the basis of international law, including the 1965 Vienna Convention on Consular Relations and the 1976 Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations.

Additional Information:
The case raises questions about the jurisdiction and admissibility of the ICJ, the violation of diplomatic immunity, and the application of international law. The Congo argues that the arrest warrant is invalid and requests its cancellation, while Belgium objects to the jurisdiction of the ICJ and argues that the case is moot.
