Title: Territorial and Maritime Dispute (Nicaragua v. Colombia)

Case Overview:
The case involves a territorial and maritime dispute between Nicaragua and Colombia. Nicaragua filed an application in 2001, initiating proceedings against Colombia. The dispute revolves around issues related to territory ownership and maritime delimitation. Colombia filed preliminary objections to jurisdiction, leading to the suspension of proceedings on the merits.

Important Details:
- Nicaragua invokes two bases of jurisdiction: Article 36, paragraph 1, and Article 36, paragraph 2, of the Statute of the International Court of Justice.
- Colombia objects to the Court's jurisdiction based on Article VI of the Pact of Bogotá.
- The validity and enforceability of the 1928 Treaty between Colombia and Nicaragua are at issue.
- Nicaragua argues that the treaty was not validly concluded and has not been in force, while Colombia argues that the Court cannot determine its validity at this stage.
- Nicaragua alleges that the treaty was concluded in violation of its constitution and that the Nicaraguan government was deprived of its international capacity during relevant periods.
- Judge Tomka believes that the Court should decide on Colombia's objection to jurisdiction at this stage.
- The document references the Pact of Bogotá, the 1928 Treaty, and the Nicaraguan Constitution.
- The Court has determined that Nicaragua's argument based on the violation of its 1911 Constitution is not valid, as Nicaragua has accepted the treaty's validity for over 50 years.
- The Court has held that Nicaragua's optional clause declaration of 1929 is valid and provides jurisdiction over the dispute.
- The case is ongoing, and the parties have been invited to submit written statements and evidence.
- Nicaragua argues that the 1928 Treaty was coerced by the United States, but the Court questions the validity of this argument.
- The issue of sovereignty over the islands of San Andrés, Providencia, and Santa Catalina cannot be adjudicated at the merits stage.
