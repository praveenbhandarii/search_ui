Title: Land Boundary in the Northern Part of Isla Portillos (Costa Rica v. Nicaragua)

Case Overview:
This case, numbered 165 in the International Court of Justice, involves a dispute between Costa Rica and Nicaragua regarding the precise definition of the boundary in the area of Los Portillos/Harbor Head Lagoon and the establishment of a new military camp by Nicaragua on the beach of Isla Portillos. Costa Rica filed an Application instituting proceedings against Nicaragua on January 16, 2017.

Important Details:
- The dispute centers around the San Juan River and Harbor Head Lagoon.
- The 1858 Treaty of Limits defines the border and allows for free navigation on the San Juan River.
- Nicaragua has constructed a military camp on disputed territory, which Costa Rica claims violates its sovereignty.
- The ICJ previously ruled on the matter in a 2015 Judgment, excluding the stretch of coast abutting the Caribbean Sea from the definition of the disputed territory.
- The Court Appointed Experts Report highlights the fast-changing geomorphological conditions in the area, including temporary channels connecting Harbor Head Lagoon with the Caribbean Sea.
- Nicaragua argues that the lagoon and a beach on northern Isla Portillos should be under Nicaraguan sovereignty according to Article I of the 1858 Treaty.
- Costa Rica disagrees with the Court's ruling on sovereignty and expresses concerns about potential future disagreements between the parties.

Document Details:
This document is a judgment type document of the International Court of Justice, dated February 2, 2018. It is related to Case Number 165, titled "Land Boundary in the Northern Part of Isla Portillos (Costa Rica v. Nicaragua)." The document provides key details about the case, including the dispute between the parties, relevant treaties and conventions, the Court's previous ruling, and the involvement of Judge Gevorgian, who delivered a separate opinion.

Additional Information:
The document discusses the Court's conclusion that the sandbar separating Nicaragua's Harbor Head Lagoon from the Caribbean Sea is situated within Costa Rican territory and is unstable. As a result, Nicaragua is not entitled to a territorial sea in that area. The Court also addresses other legal questions, such as the effects of treaties between Costa Rica and Colombia, and the use of radial projections in international jurisprudence. The Court aims to strike a fair balance between the entitlements of both parties in the Caribbean Sea and the Pacific Ocean.
