Title: Immunities and Criminal Proceedings (Equatorial Guinea v. France)

Case Overview:
The Republic of Equatorial Guinea initiated proceedings against the French Republic regarding the immunity from criminal jurisdiction of the Second Vice-President of Equatorial Guinea, Mr. Teodoro Nguema Obiang Mangue, and the legal status of the Embassy of Equatorial Guinea in France.

Document Overview:
This order, issued by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) on March 31, provides insights into the transparency of the court's deliberations. While the ICJ has made efforts to increase transparency by recording main decisions in judgments and indicating the names of judges who voted in favor or against each decision, this level of transparency is not consistently applied to orders on provisional measures. The order does not record the court's decision on the request concerning Mr. Teodoro Nguema Obiang Mangue's immunity, despite it being extensively discussed in the document.

Important Details:
- The ICJ has improved transparency in its deliberations over the years.
- Orders on provisional measures lack the same level of transparency as judgments.
- The court only records decisions that grant, possibly in modified form, requests of one of the parties.
- The order does not disclose the court's decision on Mr. Teodoro Nguema Obiang Mangue's immunity, despite it being discussed in the document.
- The lack of transparency in the order may have allowed the court to reach unanimity in all the votes stated in the order.
- Divergent views were expressed concerning the request for immunity.
- The order was issued in paragraph 95.
- The execution of any measure of conscience concerning the building at 42 Avenue Foch in Paris was deferred.
