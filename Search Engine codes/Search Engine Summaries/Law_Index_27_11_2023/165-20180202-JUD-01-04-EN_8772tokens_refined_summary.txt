Important Details:
- The legal regime of the territorial sea is distinct from that of the exclusive economic zone (EEZ), with the coastal state having sovereign rights and jurisdiction in the former, while in the latter, the coastal state only has sovereign rights and jurisdiction in respect of certain functions.
- The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) provides for the delimitation of the EEZ and the territorial sea based on equitable principles, with a focus on achieving an equitable solution.
- The document discusses the method for delimiting the territorial sea between two states, based on UNCLOS, using the median line as the basis for delimitation, with special circumstances and relevant circumstances as modifiers.
- The International Court of Justice (ICJ) has applied a dichotomous approach to delimitation, using different methods for the territorial sea and the EEZ/continental shelf, considering factors such as special circumstances, relevant circumstances, and the principle of equity.
- The document cites various cases, including the Arbitral Tribunal in Bangladesh/Myanmar and the Nicaragua v. Honduras case, to support the need for a dichotomous approach to delimitation in the territorial sea and the EEZ.
- The document highlights the difference in value between the provisional median line in the territorial sea and the provisional median line in the EEZ and continental shelf.
- The document mentions the importance of achieving an equitable solution in delimiting the various zones and emphasizes the first rule of interpretation for treaties, which is that the treaty shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty.
- The UNCLOS calls for a dichotomous approach in the delimitation methodology for the territorial sea on the one hand, and the EEZ and continental shelf on the other, but it is possible under the Convention for states to agree to utilize a uniform method.
- The difference in the legal regime for the territorial sea on the one hand and the EEZ and continental shelf on the other is also highlighted.
