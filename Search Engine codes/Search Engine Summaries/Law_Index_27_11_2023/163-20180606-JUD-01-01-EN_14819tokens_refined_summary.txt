Title: Immunities and Criminal Proceedings (Equatorial Guinea v. France)

Case Overview:
This case (Case Number 163) involves a dispute between Equatorial Guinea and France regarding the immunity from criminal jurisdiction of the Second Vice-President of Equatorial Guinea, Mr. Teodoro Nguema Obiang Mangue, and the legal status of the building housing the Embassy of Equatorial Guinea in France. Equatorial Guinea argues that France's prosecution of Mr. Mangue for money laundering breaches the Palermo Convention on Transnational Organized Crime.

Document Overview:
This judgment document from the International Court of Justice (ICJ) provides a summary of the case and presents the majority and dissenting opinions of the ICJ judges. It discusses the interpretation and application of the Palermo Convention, particularly in relation to the immunities of high-ranking state officials and state property from foreign criminal jurisdiction. The document also references previous cases and relevant principles of international law. The document includes details of other relevant cases, proposals, and discussions related to the Palermo Convention and state immunity.

Important Details:
- The majority and dissenting opinions of the ICJ judges disagree on the interpretation and application of the Palermo Convention in relation to the immunities of high-ranking state officials and state property from foreign criminal jurisdiction.
- The dissenting opinion argues that the majority has failed to recognize the effect of Article 4(1) of the Palermo Convention and has wrongly treated the principles referred to in that article as a composite whole.
- The subject-matter of the dispute is whether France, by prosecuting Mr. Mangue for money laundering and imposing measures of constraint on the building housing the Embassy of Equatorial Guinea, has violated the sovereign equality of Equatorial Guinea and the immunities of its high-ranking officials.
- The case is related to Immunities and Criminal Proceedings (Equatorial Guinea v. France), Provisional Measures, Order of 7 December 2016.

- The document cites previous cases, such as Territorial and Maritime Dispute (Nicaragua v. Colombia) and Obligation to Negotiate Access to the Pacific Ocean (Bolivia v. Chile).
- The principle of sovereign equality of states is a fundamental principle of international law, and the customary rules on foreign state immunity should not be dispensed with in the absence of any words making clear an intention to do so.
