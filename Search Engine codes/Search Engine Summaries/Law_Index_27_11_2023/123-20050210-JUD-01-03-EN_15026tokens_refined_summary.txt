Title: Certain Property (Liechtenstein v. Germany)

Case Overview:
This case, with the case number 123, involves a dispute between Liechtenstein and Germany regarding the treatment of Liechtenstein property by Germany. Liechtenstein argues that the property does not fall within the regime of the Settlement Convention, while Germany considers it as "German external assets" for the purposes of reparation. The case revolves around the question of whether the facts or situations preceding the entry into force of the Convention should be taken into account when determining the real cause of the dispute. The case also involves issues of treaty interpretation, practice dating back to 1779, and the failure of India to comply with its obligations concerning the right of passage in 1954.
