Title: Sovereignty over Pedra Branca/Pulau Batu Puteh, Middle Rocks and South Ledge (Malaysia/Singapore)

Case Overview:
This case involves a territorial dispute between Malaysia and Singapore over Pedra Branca/Pulau Batu Puteh, Middle Rocks, and South Ledge. The dispute was brought before the International Court of Justice (ICJ) through a Special Agreement signed by both parties. The Court was requested to determine the sovereignty over these islands, and both countries agreed to accept the Court's judgment as final and binding.

Important Details:
- Judge Parraranguren's separate opinion challenges the majority finding that sovereignty over Pedra Branca belongs to Singapore. The judge argues that the 1953 correspondence does not provide a valid basis for determining sovereignty.
- The judge questions the interpretation of the Johor Agreement of 1948 and the Federation of Malaya Agreement of 1948, which Malaysia relied on to argue against Singapore's claim.
- In 2007, Judge Keith requested Singapore and Malaysia's positions on the issue of Pedra Branca's sovereignty. Singapore claimed that the 1953 letter did not confirm its title to the island, while Malaysia found Singapore's response confusing and self-contradictory.
- The judge highlights Singapore's failure to assert a formal claim of sovereignty over Pedra Branca despite the ambiguous terms of the 1953 letter.
- The judge emphasizes that the 1953 letter from the Johor Acting State Secretary did not renounce Johor's title to the island but rather stated that Johor did not claim it.
- The judge criticizes Singapore's lack of action and failure to seek further information from Malaysia to clarify the status of the island.
- The judge argues that the Court should not have relied solely on the 1953 letter as the main basis for concluding Singapore's sovereign title to Pedra Branca.
