Title: Territorial and Maritime Dispute (Nicaragua v. Colombia)

Case Overview:
The case involves a territorial and maritime dispute between Nicaragua and Colombia. Nicaragua filed an application in 2001, and Colombia raised preliminary objections to jurisdiction in 2003, leading to the suspension of the proceedings on the merits. The International Court of Justice (ICJ) has the discretion to grant intervention in maritime boundary cases, and the Court's practice is based on the idea that a generalized interest in international law is not sufficient to comprise an interest of a legal nature.

Important Details:
- The ICJ considered a request by Honduras to intervene in a case between Nicaragua and Honduras regarding their maritime boundary in the Caribbean Sea.
- The Court reviewed the requirements for intervention and found that Honduras' interest of a legal nature would be affected by the reasoning of the Court's decision.
- Honduras' interest in the case is related to the maritime delimitation treaty between Colombia and Honduras, and the Court's decision may impact Honduras' rights under that treaty.
- The Court also considered Honduras' argument that the 2007 judgment in the case concerning Territorial and Maritime Dispute between Nicaragua and Honduras in the Caribbean Sea did not delimit any boundary between Honduras and Nicaragua to the east of the 82nd meridian.
- The Court held that the endpoint of the boundary set by the Court in 2007 is not fixed and remains open for determination.
- The document includes citations and dates, such as CR 2010/18, CR 2010/20, and the 2007 Judgment in the Nicaragua v. Honduras case.
