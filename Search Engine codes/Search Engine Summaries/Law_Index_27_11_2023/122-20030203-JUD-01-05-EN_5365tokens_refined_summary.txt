Title: Application for Revision of the Judgment of 11 July 1996 in the Case concerning Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Bosnia and Herzegovina v. Yugoslavia), Preliminary Objections (Yugoslavia v. Bosnia and Herzegovina)

Case Overview:
This case involves Yugoslavia's application for a revision of the International Court of Justice's (ICJ) judgment delivered on 11 July 1996. The judgment declared the ICJ's jurisdiction based on the Genocide Convention and dismissed additional bases of jurisdiction relied on by Bosnia and Herzegovina. Yugoslavia argues that its admission to the United Nations in 2000 constitutes a new fact justifying the revision of the 1996 judgment. However, the ICJ rejects Yugoslavia's request for revision.

Important Details:

- The ICJ finds that Yugoslavia's admission to the United Nations does not qualify as a new fact justifying revision.
- The Court determines that the facts presented by Yugoslavia are a reinterpretation of the same facts considered in the 1996 judgment.
