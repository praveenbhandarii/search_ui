Procedural History:
The case of D.A.S. v. Australia was brought before the United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination (CERD) as Communication No. 2234/2013. The Committee adopted views on the case on 25 March 2019 under article 22 of the Convention.

Legal Analysis and Reasoning:
The main issue in this case is whether the petitioner has exhausted all available domestic remedies before filing a complaint with the Committee. The State party argues that the petitioner has not exhausted all available remedies, while the petitioner argues that pursuing these remedies would be futile and costly. The Committee must consider whether the petitioner has met the requirements of article 14, paragraph 7(a) of the Convention, and whether the petitioner's claims have merit.

The Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination held that the petitioner had sufficiently demonstrated that the application of the Social Security Act had a discriminatory effect on Aboriginal Australians, including the petitioner. The Committee found that the respondent had not demonstrated that the differences in life expectancy between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Australians were taken into account in the design of the social security scheme. The Committee further found that the respondent had not shown that the petitioner had access to alternative forms of social security that would ensure equal enjoyment of the rights protected under the Covenant. Therefore, the Committee concluded that the respondent had violated the petitioner's rights under articles 5 and 6 of the Convention.

Decisions and Rulings:
The Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination found that Australia had violated the rights of an Aboriginal Australian man by denying him access to social security benefits. The Committee held that the application of the Social Security Act had a discriminatory effect on Aboriginal Australians, and that Australia had not demonstrated that the petitioner had access to alternative forms of social security that would ensure equal enjoyment of the rights protected under the Covenant.

Impact and Significance:
This decision highlights the importance of ensuring that domestic laws and policies do not have a discriminatory impact on marginalized communities. It emphasizes the need for governments to take steps to address disparities and ensure equal enjoyment of rights for all individuals. The case is relevant to the rights of indigenous Australians and the obligations of the State party under the Convention. If the Committee finds in favor of the petitioner, it could have implications for the age requirement for the Age Pension in Australia and potentially lead to changes in the law to address the inequality faced by indigenous Australians.
