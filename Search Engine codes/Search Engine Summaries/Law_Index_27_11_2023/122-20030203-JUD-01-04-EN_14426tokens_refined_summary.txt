Title: Application for Revision of the Judgment of 11 July 1996 in the Case concerning Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Bosnia and Herzegovina v. Yugoslavia), Preliminary Objections (Yugoslavia v. Bosnia and Herzegovina)

Case Overview:
This case involves an application for revision of a judgment delivered by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) on 11 July 1996. The judgment addressed preliminary objections raised by Yugoslavia in a case brought against it by Bosnia and Herzegovina. Yugoslavia argues that a revision of the judgment is necessary due to its status as a new Member of the United Nations and its claim that it did not continue the international legal and political personality of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. The case raises questions about the legality of certain actions taken by the UN in relation to the dispute. The application is deemed inadmissible due to the lack of demonstration of being a party to the 1996 Judgment or having a legal interest in the matter.

Important Details:
- The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY) claimed continuity with the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (SFRY) and sought recognition as a state.
- The United Nations Secretary-General and the Security Council recognized the FRY as a state, but the General Assembly did not take a position.
- The FRY's claim to continuity was contested by other states that emerged from the former SFRY, including Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Macedonia.
- The International Court of Justice ultimately decided that the FRY's claim to continuity was not "generally accepted" by the international community.
- The case involves an application for revision of a previous judgment (the 1996 Judgment) based on the analysis of legal and historical facts and relevant provisions of international law.
- The case clarifies the legal status of the FRY as a successor state of the SFRY and discusses the concept of "succession" in international law.
- The ICJ's decision highlights the importance of carefully examining the nature of the extraterritorial exercise of a state and the process of determining its successors.
- The case is relevant to the issue of access to the ICJ for states other than states parties to the Statute and the scope of the "obligations in force" provision.

Document Details:
This document is a dissenting opinion in a case related to the ICJ judgment on the Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Bosnia and Herzegovina v. Yugoslavia). It discusses the concept of "fact" in the context of the case and the importance of accurately determining the facts for jurisdictional purposes. The document includes citations and references to previous cases, international legal instruments, and the Genocide Convention. The judge's name is not provided, but it is likely from the former Yugoslavia or the region. The document argues that the FRY's constant protests against the 1996 Judgment and failure to dispute the fact that it was not a party to the Statute of ICJ are not sufficient to establish jurisdiction.

Additional Information:
The document provides insights into the complex legal and political issues surrounding the dissolution of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the formation of new states in the region. It highlights the role of the UN in resolving disputes related to state succession and membership. The case is related to the exclusion of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia from the work of the Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) due to its non-participation in the UN. The resolutions aimed to reduce the scope of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia's participation in the UN and to test whether the objections to its acting as "Yugoslavia" in the UN still existed. The document details include the date of the resolutions (1996), the UN document numbers (NPV 7 and N47/PV.101), and the names of the judges and the sponsors of the resolutions.
