Case Summary:
The case involves a complaint submitted to the United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination (CERD) by M.M., who alleged that they were a victim of a racially motivated attack in Denmark. The petitioner claimed that the police did not properly investigate the incident as a racially motivated crime. The State party disputed the allegations and argued that the assault was not racially motivated.

Procedural History:
The case was brought before the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination by M.M. The Committee issued a decision on August 27, 2008, addressing the allegations and the State party's response.

Legal Analysis and Reasoning:
The Committee considered the petitioner's claims and the State party's arguments. It found that the petitioner had sufficiently substantiated their claims for the purposes of admissibility. The Committee also observed that the State party had failed to properly investigate and prosecute the assault, violating articles 2, paragraph 1(d), and 6 of the Convention.

Decisions and Rulings:
The Committee declared the petition admissible and concluded that the State party had failed to fulfill its positive obligation to protect the rights of the petitioner under the Convention. The Committee requested the State party to review and improve its policies and procedures in line with its obligations under Article 4 of the Convention.

Impact and Significance:
The decision highlights the importance of States' obligations under the Convention to protect individuals from racial discrimination and to provide effective remedies for victims of such discrimination. It also emphasizes the need for proper investigation and prosecution of racially motivated crimes. The recommendations made by the Committee may have implications for other cases involving racial discrimination and may influence the development of policies and procedures related to the prosecution of such crimes.
