Title: Frontier Dispute (Benin/Niger)

Case Overview:
The case involves a frontier dispute between Benin and Niger regarding the definitive delimitation of their boundary, specifically focusing on the course of the boundary in the River Niger sector and the attribution of islands therein. The parties submitted the dispute to the International Court of Justice (ICJ) through a Special Agreement, and a special Chamber of five judges was formed to handle the case. The case highlights the significance of effectivits (administrative practices) at the critical date of August 1960 in determining the boundary between the two countries.

Important Details:
- The case applies the principle of uti possidetis juris, which aims to stabilize colonial boundaries and prevent new states from engaging in disputes.
- The court examines the effectivits at the critical date of August 1960 to determine the boundary between Benin and Niger, giving precedence to legal title or effectivits at that time.
- The case relies on the Frontier Dispute (Burkina Faso/Republic of Mali) case and the ICJ judgment in that case as guidelines.
- The historical background of the creation of the colonies of Dahomey and Niger is relevant to the boundary's course.
- The Chamber found that neither party had a legal title, so the effectivits of Benin were considered in determining the boundary.
- The case emphasizes the importance of stability in inherited colonial borders to prevent disputes and confrontations.
- The two countries should be credited for seeking a judicial settlement of their border dispute and for pursuing their cooperation in respect of the boundary rivers.
