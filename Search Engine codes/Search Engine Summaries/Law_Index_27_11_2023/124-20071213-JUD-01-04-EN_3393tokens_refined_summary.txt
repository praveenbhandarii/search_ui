Title: Territorial and Maritime Dispute (Nicaragua v. Colombia)

Case Overview:
The case involves a territorial and maritime dispute between Nicaragua and Colombia. Nicaragua filed an application in 2001, initiating proceedings against Colombia regarding a group of related legal issues concerning territory and maritime delimitation. Colombia raised preliminary objections to jurisdiction, leading to the suspension of the proceedings on the merits.

Important Details:
- The dispute revolves around sovereignty over the islands of San Andrés, Providencia, and Santa Catalina.
- A 1928 Treaty between Nicaragua and Colombia settled the question of sovereignty over the islands.
- The Pact of Bogotá, which established the International Court of Justice (ICJ), granted it jurisdiction over disputes between states.
- Optional clause declarations made by states under Article 36(2) of the ICJ Statute allow acceptance of the ICJ's jurisdiction over disputes arising after the declaration is made.
- Colombia raised jurisdictional objections, challenging the ICJ's jurisdiction over the dispute.
- The ICJ found that it had jurisdiction based on the Pact of Bogotá and the optional clause declarations of the parties.
- Nicaragua's reliance on jurisdiction based on the optional clause declarations was deemed not viable as there was no existing legal dispute on the question of sovereignty over the islands.
- The ICJ concluded that there was no practical purpose in further proceeding with the matters of Colombia's termination of its declaration and its reservation ratione temporis.

Additional Information:
In a separate document, the ICJ's judgment in the case of Nicaragua v. Colombia from 1984 is referenced. The judgment, delivered on 26 June 1984, involved Judge Bruno Simma and addressed the invalidity of the 1928 Treaty. However, the present document does not fully consider Nicaragua's arguments concerning the treaty's invalidity.
