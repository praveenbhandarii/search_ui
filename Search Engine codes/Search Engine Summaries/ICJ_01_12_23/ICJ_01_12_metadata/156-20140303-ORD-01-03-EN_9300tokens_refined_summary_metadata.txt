The jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice (ICJ) was invoked by both parties.",
  "Case Summary": "Timor-Leste alleged that Australia violated its rights under international law by seizing the documents and interfering with its right to conduct arbitration proceedings or negotiations without interference. The ICJ considered the need for provisional measures to prevent irreparable harm to Timor-Leste's rights and the potential risks associated with the seized material. One judge dissented, expressing concerns about the measures ordered by the ICJ and the potential harm to Australia's plausible rights.",
