    "Document Summary": "Qatar instituted proceedings against the UAE, alleging violations of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (CERD). The majority of judges upheld the UAE's preliminary objections, challenging the jurisdiction of the court, while Judge Sebutinde and Judge Bhandari dissented. The case raises questions about the interpretation of 'national origin' in CERD and its relevance to discrimination claims based on current nationality.",
    "Case Summary": "Qatar alleges racial discrimination and indirect discrimination against persons of Qatari national origin by the UAE. The UAE argues that its measures are necessary for public order and security. The court examines whether the dispute falls within its jurisdiction under Article 22 of CERD and whether the claims fall within the scope of CERD. The measures adopted by the UAE disproportionately affect Qatari nationals and may fall within the scope of CERD.",
