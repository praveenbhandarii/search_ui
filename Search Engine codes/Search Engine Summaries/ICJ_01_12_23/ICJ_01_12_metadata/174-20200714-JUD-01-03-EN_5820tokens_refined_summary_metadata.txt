    "Case Summary": "This document is a separate opinion of Judge ad hoc Berman in an appeal before the ICJ, filed by Bahrain, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE against the decision of the ICAO Council. It highlights the difficulties in interpreting Article 84 of the Chicago Convention and the role of the ICAO Council in the dispute settlement process. It argues that the Court missed an opportunity to clarify the jurisdiction of the ICAO Council and that its finding may lead to future misunderstandings or confusion. The document emphasizes that the Council's functions are not judicial in nature but rather to provide authoritative rulings based on its specialist expertise. It suggests that the Court should have subjected the Council's decision to more nuanced attention, particularly with regard to due process considerations. The document also discusses the interpretation and application of Article 84 of the Chicago Convention and raises concerns about the Court's failure to address the underlying issues and provide clarity on the Council's jurisdiction.",
