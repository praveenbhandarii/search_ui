  "Case Summary": "Timor-Leste initiated proceedings against Australia regarding the seizure and detention of documents, data, and other property belonging to Timor-Leste or protected under international law. The items were allegedly seized from the offices of one of Timor-Leste's legal advisers in Australia. Timor-Leste claimed that the seized materials included correspondence related to a pending arbitration under the Timor Sea Treaty. The jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice (ICJ) was invoked based on declarations made by both parties. Timor-Leste sought provisional measures to protect its rights, including the inviolability and immunity of the seized property and the confidentiality of communications with legal advisers.",
