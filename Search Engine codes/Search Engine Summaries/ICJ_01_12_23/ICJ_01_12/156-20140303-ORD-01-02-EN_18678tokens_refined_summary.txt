Document Date: March 25, 2015
Key Parties Involved: Timor-Leste, Australia
Case Name: Questions relating to the Seizure and Detention of Certain Documents and Data (Timor-Leste v. Australia)

Case Summary:
Timor-Leste initiated proceedings against Australia regarding the seizure and detention of documents, data, and other property belonging to Timor-Leste or protected under international law. The items were seized from the offices of one of Timor-Leste's legal advisers in Australia. Timor-Leste claimed that the seized items included correspondence related to a pending arbitration under the Timor Sea Treaty. Timor-Leste invoked its declaration under Article 36, paragraph 2, of the Statute as the basis for the Court's jurisdiction.

Context:
- Timor-Leste alleged that the seizure and detention of the documents and data violated its rights under international law.
- Australia argued that the ownership of the seized items could not be determined without examining the documents.
- The ICJ ordered provisional measures to protect Timor-Leste's rights and prevent further harm.
- Australia raised allegations of national security, but the ICJ held that it could not consider them as they fell outside the scope of the arbitration.
- The ICJ emphasized the principle of juridical equality of states and the importance of objective justice in international legal proceedings.
- The ICJ rejected Australia's argument invoking the rule of exhaustion of local remedies and the alleged risks of parallelism and fragmentation of international law.
- The ICJ expressed concerns about the breach of confidentiality and potential harm to Timor-Leste's position in the arbitration and future negotiations.
