Case ID: ICJ/153
Court/Tribunal: International Court of Justice (ICJ)
Document Date: October 1, 2018
Key Parties Involved: Bolivia, Chile
Case Name: Obligation to Negotiate Access to the Pacific Ocean (Bolivia v. Chile)

Case Summary:
The case involves a dispute between Bolivia and Chile regarding Bolivia's sovereign access to the Pacific Ocean. Bolivia argues that Chile has an obligation to negotiate in good faith and effectively to reach an agreement granting Bolivia fully sovereign access to the sea. Bolivia claims that Chile has not complied with this obligation and denies its existence. Bolivia invokes Article XXXI of the American Treaty on Pacific Settlement as the basis for the jurisdiction of the Court.

Context:
- Bolivia asserts that Chile has committed itself, through agreements, diplomatic practice, and declarations, to negotiate sovereign access to the sea for Bolivia.
- The dispute stems from the 1866 Treaty that demarcated the boundary between Chile and Bolivia and separated their Pacific coast territories.
- Chile has occupied Bolivia's coastal territory since the War of the Pacific, and the 1904 Peace Treaty recognized Chile's ownership of the coastal region.
- Bolivia has requested the revision of the 1904 Peace Treaty to gain sovereign access to the Pacific Ocean.
- The ICJ held that Chile has an obligation to negotiate sovereign access to the Pacific Ocean with Bolivia.
- The ICJ based its decision on bilateral agreements, Chile's declarations and other unilateral acts, acquiescence, estoppel, legitimate expectations, and international charters.
