Case Name: Alleged Violations of Sovereign Rights and Maritime Spaces in the Caribbean Sea (Nicaragua v. Colombia)

Case Summary:
This case involves a dispute between Nicaragua and Colombia regarding the violations of Nicaragua's sovereign rights and maritime zones declared by the Court's Judgment of 19 November 2012. Nicaragua filed an application instituting proceedings against Colombia, alleging the threat of the use of force by Colombia to implement these violations. The International Court of Justice (ICJ) has jurisdiction over the case based on Article XXXI of the Pact of Bogot. The ICJ's judgment was issued in 2016.

Context:
- The dispute between Nicaragua and Colombia concerns the delimitation of their maritime boundary.
- Judge Caron dissented from the Court's judgment, arguing that the requirement of a dispute existing before the Court can exercise jurisdiction has been fundamentally weakened.
- The case involves a discussion of the meaning of the term "dispute" in international law and the requirements for the Court's jurisdiction over a case.
- The ICJ's jurisprudence on the meaning of "dispute" has been consistent over time, requiring positive opposition by one state against another.
- The Court considered whether settlement was possible and found that the Parties had not demonstrated a prospect of settlement through direct negotiations.
- The Court emphasized the importance of the applicant state clearly stating its claim of legal violation to the respondent state prior to the date of its application.
- Nicaragua's President Ortega made statements emphasizing the need for a treaty to implement the ICJ's judgment, but did not explicitly claim a breach by Colombia.
- Colombia filed preliminary objections, arguing that Nicaragua had not demonstrated the existence of a dispute.
- The Court's judgment addressed the issue of a dispute and the requirement for positive opposition by the parties.
