Case ID: ICJ/172
Court/Tribunal: International Court of Justice (ICJ)
Document Date: 2021
Key Parties Involved: Qatar, United Arab Emirates (UAE)
Case Name: Application of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (Qatar v. United Arab Emirates)

Case Summary:
Qatar filed a case against the UAE alleging violations of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (CERD). Qatar accuses the UAE of expelling all Qataris from the country and engaging in racial discrimination against them. Qatar requests the ICJ to declare the UAE responsible for violating its obligations under Articles 2, 4, 5, 6, and 7 of the CERD. Qatar also seeks an order for the UAE to cease its internationally wrongful acts and omissions, provide full reparation for the harm caused, and provide assurances and guarantees of non-repetition. The UAE raised three preliminary objections against the jurisdiction of the Court and the admissibility of Qatar's claims.

Context:
- The dispute arises from the UAE's measures taken against Qatar and Qatari nationals after a diplomatic crisis in 2017.
- Qatar argues that the UAE's measures target a protected group based on national or ethnic origin, constituting racial discrimination.
- The CERD defines racial discrimination as any distinction, exclusion, restriction, or preference based on race, color, descent, or national or ethnic origin.
- The Court is examining whether the measures taken by the UAE fall within the scope of the CERD and whether Qatar's claims are admissible.
- The case raises complex issues regarding the interpretation of Article 1, paragraph 1, of the CERD, particularly the distinction between national origin and nationality.
