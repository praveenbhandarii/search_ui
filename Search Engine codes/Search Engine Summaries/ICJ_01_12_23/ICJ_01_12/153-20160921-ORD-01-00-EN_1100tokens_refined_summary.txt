Case Summary:
The case involves a dispute between Bolivia and Chile regarding Chile's obligation to negotiate in good faith and effectively with Bolivia to grant it fully sovereign access to the Pacific Ocean. Bolivia claims that Chile has committed itself to negotiate a sovereign access to the sea for Bolivia through agreements, diplomatic practice, and declarations made by its highest-level representatives.
