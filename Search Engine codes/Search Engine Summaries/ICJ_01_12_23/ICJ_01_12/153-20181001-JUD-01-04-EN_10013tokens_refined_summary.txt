Court/Tribunal: International Court of Justice (ICJ)
Document Date: 2018
Key Parties Involved: Bolivia, Chile
Case Name: Obligation to Negotiate Access to the Pacific Ocean (Bolivia v. Chile)

Case Summary:
The case involves a dispute between Bolivia and Chile regarding Bolivia's sovereign access to the Pacific Ocean. Bolivia claims that Chile has an obligation to negotiate in good faith and effectively to grant Bolivia fully sovereign access to the sea. Bolivia argues that Chile has not fulfilled this obligation and denies its existence. The jurisdiction of the Court is invoked based on Article XXXI of the American Treaty on Pacific Settlement. The Court's decision endorses Chile's position that the 1920 Act and the 1950 Notes are not legally binding. However, the Court finds that the 1950 Notes are politically significant and demonstrate the intent of the parties to enter into negotiations.
