- Colombia raised five preliminary objections, with the fifth objection being the subject of analysis in this document.
- The majority of judges concluded that there was a dispute between the parties, based on the conduct of the parties prior to Nicaragua's application.
- The analysis focused on Colombia's alleged noncompliance with the 2012 judgment, despite criticisms that it ignored clear assertions by both parties.
- Colombia's second preliminary objection was rejected, and Nicaragua's claim was not allowed to advance to the merits phase of the case.
