Case ID: ICJ/172
Court/Tribunal: International Court of Justice (ICJ)
Document Date: 2019
Key Parties Involved: Qatar, United Arab Emirates (UAE)
Case Name: Application of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (Qatar v. United Arab Emirates)

Case Summary:
Qatar instituted proceedings against the UAE for alleged violations of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (CERD). The case involves requests for provisional measures of protection and addresses the issue of a continuing situation affecting human rights under the CERD Convention. The ICJ has jurisdiction over the case based on Qatar's request, and the provisional measures ordered in 2018 remain in force.

Context:
- Qatar's request seeks provisional measures to protect the rights of vulnerable individuals under the CERD Convention.
- The UAE's request does not refer to the same rights and must be considered separately from Qatar's request.
- Qatar invokes the protection of rights under the CERD Convention, while the UAE does not relate vulnerability to rights safeguarded under the Convention.
- The ICJ has the power to indicate provisional measures if the rights asserted by the requesting party are plausible and a link exists between the rights and the measures requested.
- The UAE's request does not establish a link between the rights at issue and the provisional measures requested.
- Inconsistencies in the UAE's request regarding the CERD Convention and the CERD Committee need to be addressed by the ICJ.
- The case highlights the importance of equality, nondiscrimination, and the prohibition of arbitrariness in the application of the CERD Convention.
