Case Name: Obligations concerning Negotiations relating to Cessation of the Nuclear Arms Race and to Nuclear Disarmament (Marshall Islands v. India)

Case Summary:
The Republic of the Marshall Islands filed applications against nine states, including India, accusing them of not fulfilling their obligations regarding the cessation of the nuclear arms race and nuclear disarmament. The case revolves around India's compliance with its obligation to negotiate nuclear disarmament as stated in a United Nations resolution. The Marshall Islands asserts that there is a disagreement between the parties on the immediate commencement and conclusion of multilateral negotiations on nuclear disarmament. India, however, has consistently supported the immediate commencement and conclusion of such negotiations aimed at the elimination of nuclear weapons. The case is being heard before the International Court of Justice.

Context:
- The case is based on Article VI of the Non-Proliferation Treaty and customary international law, which obligates India to pursue multilateral negotiations on nuclear disarmament in good faith.
- The Marshall Islands relies on a statement made by its Foreign Minister at a conference as evidence of the existence of a dispute with India.
- The judge's opinion disagrees with the judgment in the case, which introduced a new subjective requirement of awareness in determining the existence or nonexistence of a dispute.
- The case is related to the interpretation and application of a comprehensive convention on nuclear disarmament.
