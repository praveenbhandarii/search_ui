Case ID: ICJ/156
Court/Tribunal: International Court of Justice (ICJ)
Document Date: 2014
Key Parties Involved: Timor-Leste, Australia
Case Name: Questions relating to the Seizure and Detention of Certain Documents and Data (Timor-Leste v. Australia)

Case Summary:
Timor-Leste initiated proceedings against Australia regarding the seizure and detention of documents, data, and other property belonging to Timor-Leste or protected under international law. The items were seized from the offices of one of Timor-Leste's legal advisers in Australia. Timor-Leste claimed that the seized items included correspondence related to a pending arbitration under the Timor Sea Treaty. Timor-Leste invoked its declaration under Article 36, paragraph 2 of the Statute as the basis for jurisdiction. Australia acknowledged the ICJ's compulsory jurisdiction but made a reservation regarding the delimitation of maritime zones.

Context:
- Timor-Leste contended that the seizure occurred under a warrant issued under the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Act of 1979.
- Timor-Leste argued that the ICJ has prima facie jurisdiction over the dispute and that the case is urgent.
- Australia informed the ICJ that it will not contest jurisdictional or admissibility matters at this stage of the proceedings.
- Timor-Leste requested the ICJ to order Australia not to access or use the seized documents.
- The ICJ considered whether the Attorney General of Australia was exercising a judicial or quasi-judicial function when signing the warrants for the raid.
- The ICJ found that the Attorney General is a member of the Executive and not a judge or quasi-judge, and therefore, the signing of the warrants was not a judicial or quasi-judicial function.
- The ICJ required Australia to notify the court and Timor-Leste before accessing or using any of the seized documents.
