Case ID: ICJ/172
Court/Tribunal: International Court of Justice (ICJ)
Document Date: 2021
Key Parties Involved: Qatar, United Arab Emirates (UAE)
Case Name: Application of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (Qatar v. United Arab Emirates)

Case Summary:
Qatar instituted proceedings against the UAE, alleging violations of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (CERD). The dispute revolves around the interpretation and application of CERD, specifically regarding the UAE's measures against Qatari nationals. Qatar claims that these measures constitute indirect discrimination based on national origin, while the UAE denies any discrimination and argues that the measures are not based on national origin. The court's decision on the preliminary objections will likely impact the merits of Qatar's claim.

Context:
- The document discusses the interpretation of the term "national origin" in CERD and how it differs from "nationality."
- The CERD Committee recognizes indirect discrimination as a form of discrimination that can be demonstrated circumstantially.
- Other human rights bodies and courts, such as the Human Rights Committee and the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR), have embraced the notion of indirect discrimination.
- The court distinguishes between national origin and nationality, with the former referring to the country or place of birth, while the latter refers to the legal bond between a person and a state.
- The court cites various case laws and jurisprudence to support its interpretation, including Andrejeva v. Latvia and D. H. and Others v. Czech Republic.
