Case Name: Obligations concerning Negotiations relating to Cessation of the Nuclear Arms Race and to Nuclear Disarmament (Marshall Islands v. India)

Case Summary:
The Republic of the Marshall Islands filed applications against nine states, including India, accusing them of not fulfilling their obligations regarding the cessation of the nuclear arms race and nuclear disarmament. The case revolves around India's alleged failure to negotiate nuclear disarmament. India raised preliminary objections to the jurisdiction of the ICJ, arguing that there is no dispute between the parties and that the court lacks jurisdiction to deal with the case. The ICJ considered India's objections and found them substantial, leading to the dismissal of the case.

- The ICJ emphasized the importance of the formulation of the dispute chosen by the applicant and the objective evaluation of the dispute.
- The ICJ cited previous cases to establish the criteria for the existence of a dispute, including the need for an actual conflict of legal views or interests between parties.

- India has proposed initiatives for nuclear disarmament and supports the negotiation of treaties banning the future production of missile material for nuclear weapons.
- The Marshall Islands and India have similar positions on nuclear disarmament but differ on the adequacy of India's actions to meet its obligations under international law.
