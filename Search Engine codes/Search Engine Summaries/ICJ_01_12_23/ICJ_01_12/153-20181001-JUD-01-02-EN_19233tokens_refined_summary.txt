Key Parties Involved: Bolivia, Chile
Case Name: Obligation to Negotiate Access to the Pacific Ocean (Bolivia v. Chile)

Case Summary:
The case revolves around Bolivia's demand for sovereign access to the Pacific Ocean and Chile's obligation to negotiate this access. Bolivia argues that Chile has committed itself to negotiate sovereign access through agreements, diplomatic practice, and declarations. However, Chile denies the existence of this obligation. Bolivia invoked Article XXXI of the American Treaty on Pacific Settlement as the basis for the jurisdiction of the Court.

Context:
- Dispute over access to the Pacific Ocean since the 1879 War of the Pacific
- 1904 Treaty of Peace and Friendship confirmed Chile's sovereignty over coastal territory but granted Bolivia a right of commercial transit
- 1919 Chile expressed willingness to negotiate a separate outlet for Bolivia
- Bolivia cites Trucco Memorandum (1961) and Charaa Declarations (1975, 1977) as evidence of Chile's obligation
- Dissenting opinion argues that the 1920 Act/Minutes and the 1926 Proposal from the US Secretary of State also establish Chile's obligation
