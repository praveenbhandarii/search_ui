Context:
- The existence of a dispute is determined objectively by the Court.
- Direct diplomatic exchanges between parties prior to filing an application can indicate opposition to the other party's claim.
- Filing an application in a contentious case does not create a dispute.
- The Court considers evidence to determine if a dispute existed as of the date of the application.
- The Court does not solely rely on parties' statements in court to establish the existence of a dispute.
- The Court examines the content and context of statements made by one party before the application to assess if there was a difference of views.
- Recent cases before the Court have consistently applied an objective standard to evaluate presented evidence.
- The essential question is whether the respondent was aware of the applicant's claim based on the clarity of the applicant's statements.
