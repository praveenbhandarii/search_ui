Document Date: 2018
Key Parties Involved: Qatar, United Arab Emirates (UAE)
Case Name: Application of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (Qatar v. United Arab Emirates)

Case Summary:
Qatar filed a case against the UAE on 11 June 2018, alleging violations of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (CERD). The dispute revolves around the treatment of Qatari nationals by the UAE.

Context:
- Qatar initiated proceedings against the UAE based on alleged discrimination against Qatari nationals due to their national origin.
- The case is related to the interpretation and jurisdiction of the ICJ under the CERD.
- The CERD Committee believes that the Convention should cover discrimination based on nationality, but it has not explicitly equated nationality with national origin.
- The ICJ ruled that the dispute does not fall within the scope of the CERD and that Qatar's rights invoked under the Convention are not plausible.
- However, the ICJ acknowledged that the UAE's actions may be inconsistent with other rules of international law.
- The case is still pending before the ICJ, and no final decision has been rendered.
