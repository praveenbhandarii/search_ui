Case ID: ICJ/156
Court/Tribunal: International Court of Justice (ICJ)
Document Date: 2014
Key Parties Involved: Timor-Leste, Australia
Case Name: Questions relating to the Seizure and Detention of Certain Documents and Data (Timor-Leste v. Australia)

Case Summary:
Timor-Leste initiated proceedings against Australia regarding the seizure and detention of documents, data, and other property belonging to Timor-Leste or protected under international law. The items were seized from the offices of one of Timor-Leste's legal advisers in Australia. Timor-Leste claimed that the seized items included correspondence related to a pending arbitration under the Timor Sea Treaty. The jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice (ICJ) was invoked by both parties.

Context:
- Timor-Leste alleged that Australia violated its rights under international law by seizing the documents and interfering with its right to conduct arbitration proceedings or negotiations without interference.
- Australia provided an undertaking to the ICJ that it would not access the seized material in any future negotiations or arbitration proceedings related to the Timor Sea.
- The ICJ considered the need for provisional measures to prevent irreparable harm to Timor-Leste's rights and the potential risks associated with the seized material.
- The ICJ ordered Australia to seal the seized material until the final judgment is made.
- One judge dissented, expressing concerns about the measures ordered by the ICJ and the potential harm to Australia's plausible rights.
- The ICJ also ordered Australia to provide assurance that it will not interfere with Timor-Leste's communications with its legal advisers in the future.
