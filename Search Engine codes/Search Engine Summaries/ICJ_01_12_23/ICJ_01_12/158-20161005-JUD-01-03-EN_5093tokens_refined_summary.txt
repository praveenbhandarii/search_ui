Case ID: ICJ/158
Court/Tribunal: International Court of Justice (ICJ)
Document Date: 2016
Key Parties Involved: Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI), India
Case Name: Obligations concerning Negotiations relating to Cessation of the Nuclear Arms Race and to Nuclear Disarmament (Marshall Islands v. India)

Case Summary:
The Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI) filed applications against nine states, including India, accusing them of not fulfilling their obligations regarding the cessation of the nuclear arms race and nuclear disarmament. The main issue in this case is whether the ICJ has jurisdiction to hear the RMI's case. Judge Owada concludes that the RMI's position on the duties of nuclear-weapon states under the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) is not enough to establish a concrete legal dispute capable of adjudication by the Court.

Context:
- The RMI argued that India's noncompliance with its obligation to pursue negotiations leading to nuclear disarmament constituted a dispute.
- The ICJ held that a legal dispute requires a positive opposition between the parties, manifested through a claim or protest.
- The ICJ found that the evidence presented by the RMI was insufficient to establish the existence of a dispute.
- The judgment does not automatically bar the examination of a new claim on its merits in the future.
