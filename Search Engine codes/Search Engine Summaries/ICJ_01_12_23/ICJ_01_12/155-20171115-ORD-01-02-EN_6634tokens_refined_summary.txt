Case ID: ICJ/155
Court/Tribunal: International Court of Justice (ICJ)
Document Date: 2017
Key Parties Involved: Nicaragua, Colombia
Case Name: Alleged Violations of Sovereign Rights and Maritime Spaces in the Caribbean Sea (Nicaragua v. Colombia)

Case Summary:
Nicaragua filed an application against Colombia in 2013, alleging violations of its sovereign rights and maritime zones. The dispute concerns the violations declared by the Court's judgment in 2012 and the threat of force by Colombia to implement these violations. Colombia has filed counterclaims against Nicaragua. The ICJ has jurisdiction over the third and fourth counterclaims made by Colombia.

Context:
- The ICJ has the discretion to entertain a counterclaim if it meets the requirements of being directly connected to the subject matter of the original application.
- A counterclaim is an independent claim and a reaction to the claim of the other party.
- The ICJ has never refused to entertain a counterclaim that meets the requirements.
- The case of Costa Rica v. Nicaragua and Construction of a Road in Costa Rica along the San Juan River (Nicaragua v. Costa Rica) considered a counterclaim.
- The Court has jurisdiction over the dispute between Nicaragua and Colombia regarding sovereign rights and maritime spaces in the Caribbean Sea.
- The Court lacks jurisdiction over Colombia's first and second counterclaims as they are not part of the original dispute brought by Nicaragua.
- The Court has relied on its jurisprudence in the Nottebohm case to determine the critical date for the establishment of its jurisdiction.
- The Court has dismissed Colombia's counterclaims and found that it lacks jurisdiction over them.
