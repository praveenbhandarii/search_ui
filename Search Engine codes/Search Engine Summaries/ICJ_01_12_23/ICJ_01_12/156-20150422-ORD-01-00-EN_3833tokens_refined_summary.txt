Case ID: ICJ/156
Court/Tribunal: International Court of Justice (ICJ)
Document Date: 2015
Key Parties Involved: Timor-Leste, Australia
Case Name: Questions relating to the Seizure and Detention of Certain Documents and Data (Timor-Leste v. Australia)

Case Summary:
Timor-Leste initiated proceedings against Australia regarding the seizure and detention of documents, data, and other property belonging to Timor-Leste or protected under international law. These items were allegedly seized under a warrant issued by Australia. The seized materials included correspondence between the Government of Timor-Leste and its legal advisers related to a pending arbitration under the Timor Sea Treaty. Timor-Leste invoked its declaration under Article 36, paragraph 2 of the Statute as the basis for the Court's jurisdiction.

Context:
- Timor-Leste claimed that the seizure and detention violated its sovereignty and territorial integrity.
- Australia argued that the seizure was necessary to protect national security and prevent the disclosure of classified information.
- The ICJ granted a joint request to postpone oral proceedings and considered Australia's change in position regarding the return of the documents as a change in the situation.
- The ICJ found that Timor-Leste's right to conduct arbitral proceedings and negotiations without interference could suffer irreparable harm if the confidentiality of the seized material was not safeguarded.
