Case Name: Obligations concerning Negotiations relating to Cessation of the Nuclear Arms Race and to Nuclear Disarmament (Marshall Islands v. India)

Case Summary:
The Republic of the Marshall Islands filed applications against nine states, including India, accusing them of not fulfilling their obligations regarding the cessation of the nuclear arms race and nuclear disarmament. However, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) found that there was no dispute between the parties at the time the applications were filed, and therefore, it could not entertain the cases. The court decided not to examine other objections raised by the respondent states. The judgments of the court allow the Marshall Islands to initiate new proceedings on the same matters if desired.
