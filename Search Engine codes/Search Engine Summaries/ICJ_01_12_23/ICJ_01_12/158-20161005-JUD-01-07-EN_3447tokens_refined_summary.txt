Case Name: Obligations concerning Negotiations relating to Cessation of the Nuclear Arms Race and to Nuclear Disarmament (Marshall Islands v. India)

Case Summary:
The Republic of the Marshall Islands filed applications against nine states, including India, accusing them of not fulfilling their obligations regarding the cessation of the nuclear arms race and nuclear disarmament. This specific document is a judgment from the ICJ regarding preliminary objections raised by the United States in a case filed by the Marshall Islands. The United States argued that there was no dispute between the parties, and therefore the Court lacked jurisdiction. The ICJ dismissed the case, stating that there was no dispute at the time the application was filed.

Context:
- The Marshall Islands argued for a broader consideration of the interests of the international community in nuclear disarmament cases.
- The ICJ emphasized the need for a clear legal claim to establish jurisdiction.
- Statements made by the Marshall Islands at international conferences were deemed insufficient to demonstrate a legal dispute.
- The Court referred to its Advisory Opinion on the Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons and emphasized the obligation of all states parties to the NPT to negotiate in good faith on nuclear disarmament.
