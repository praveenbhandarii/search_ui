- The legal principles and instruments relied upon by Colombia are rules of customary international law and instruments relating to the protection of the marine environment, while Nicaragua relies on customary international law rules relating to the law of the sea as reflected in Parts V and VI of UNCLOS.
- The counterclaims brought by Yugoslavia against Bosnia and Herzegovina related to the delimitation of their maritime boundaries were considered by the ICJ, which applied the principle of direct connection to determine their admissibility.
- The ICJ found that there was no direct connection between the counterclaims and the principal claim in this case, leading to the counterclaims being deemed inadmissible.
