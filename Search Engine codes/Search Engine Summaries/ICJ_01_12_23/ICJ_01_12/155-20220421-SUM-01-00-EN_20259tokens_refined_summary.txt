Document Date: 2022
Key Parties Involved: Nicaragua, Colombia
Case Name: Alleged Violations of Sovereign Rights and Maritime Spaces in the Caribbean Sea (Nicaragua v. Colombia)

Case Summary:
Nicaragua filed an application against Colombia in 2013, alleging violations of Nicaragua's sovereign rights and maritime zones. The dispute arose from Colombia's actions following a judgment by the ICJ in 2012 regarding a territorial and maritime dispute between the two countries. Nicaragua claimed that Colombia interfered with its fishing and marine scientific research activities in its exclusive economic zone (EEZ), granted permits for fishing and research to Colombians and nationals of third states in Nicaragua's EEZ, violated Nicaragua's exclusive sovereign right to explore and exploit natural resources in its EEZ, established an integral contiguous zone that overlapped with Nicaragua's EEZ, and pushed the external limit of its territorial sea beyond the permitted 12-mile limit. Nicaragua sought remedies for these alleged violations.
