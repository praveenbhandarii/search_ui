Case Name: Application of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (Qatar v. United Arab Emirates)

Case Summary:
Qatar filed a case against the UAE, alleging violations of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (CERD). The case revolves around measures imposed by the UAE on Qatari nationals, including entry restrictions and a 14-day deadline to leave the country. Qatar argues that these measures target Qataris based on their nationality, violating the CERD.

Context:
- The document is a dissenting opinion by Judge Crawford in a case related to the Gulf crisis and human rights abuses.
- The UAE announced measures against Qatari nationals, citing security reasons.
- The document examines the legality of these measures under international law, particularly the CERD.
- The author argues that the measures do not violate the CERD as they target nationality, not national origin.
- The document discusses the difficulty of proving the ongoing effect of the measures and their impact on Qatari nationals' rights.
- The UAE Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation announced the measures in a statement on June 5, 2017.
- Evidence shows that Qataris have been leaving the UAE as a result of the statement.
- The case also involves the humanitarian circumstances of Emirati-Qatari joint families during the Gulf crisis.
- The UAE set up a hotline to assist with the humanitarian circumstances of these families.
- Qataris were unable to live with their family members due to the measures.
- The UAE provided evidence of approving permits for Qataris to enter the country.
- Qatar argued that approvals were temporary and needed for every entry into the UAE.
- The hotline was described as a police security channel provided by the Abu Dhabi police.
- Some individuals were hesitant to contact the hotline due to concerns about being identified as Qataris.
- Thousands of applications by Qataris for permits to enter the UAE have been approved since June 2017.
- Many consequences of the measures appear to stem from Qataris being located outside the UAE, rather than deliberate policy.
- It is unclear if individuals continue to suffer these consequences as of July 2018.
- The UAE stated that the number of Qataris living in the UAE is similar to before June 5, 2017.
- The document is a ruling by Judge Crawford regarding provisional measures in the case.
- Qatar requested provisional measures, alleging violations of the CERD.
- Judge Crawford found no risk of irreparable prejudice in this case.
- The UAE's statement of July 5, 2018, clarified the legal position of Qataris in the UAE, removing the risk of prejudice to their rights under the CERD.
- Over 8,000 Qataris have entered or exited the UAE since June 2017, and over 1,300 applications via the hotline have been granted.
- The court emphasized the legal requirements for provisional measures, including irreparable prejudice and urgency, which were not met in this case.
- The court did not object to the imposition of provisional measures to alleviate remaining difficulties faced by Qataris in the UAE.
