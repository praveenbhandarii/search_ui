Case Summary:
The Republic of the Marshall Islands filed applications against nine states, including India, Pakistan, and the United Kingdom, accusing them of not fulfilling their obligations regarding the cessation of the nuclear arms race and nuclear disarmament. This document is a judgment type document of the International Court of Justice (ICJ) and discusses the lack of jurisdiction in the cases brought by the Marshall Islands against the aforementioned states. The majority of the ICJ concluded that no dispute exists and therefore the court does not have jurisdiction to hear the case further.
