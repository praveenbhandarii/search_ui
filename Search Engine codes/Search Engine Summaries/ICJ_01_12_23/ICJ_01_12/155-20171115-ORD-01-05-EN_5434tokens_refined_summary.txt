Case ID: ICJ/155
Court/Tribunal: International Court of Justice (ICJ)
Document Date: 2017
Key Parties Involved: Nicaragua, Colombia
Case Name: Alleged Violations of Sovereign Rights and Maritime Spaces in the Caribbean Sea (Nicaragua v. Colombia)

Case Summary:
Nicaragua filed an application against Colombia in 2013, alleging violations of its sovereign rights and maritime zones as declared by the ICJ's judgment in 2012. The dispute also involved the threat of force by Colombia to implement these violations. The case revolves around the delimitation of the maritime boundary, fishing licenses, marine research authorizations, and the duty of due diligence to protect the marine environment.

Context:
- The case concerns the violations of Nicaragua's sovereign rights and maritime zones declared by the ICJ's judgment in 2012.
- Colombia denounced the Pact of Bogot, which is relevant to the jurisdiction of the ICJ, on November 27, 2012.
- Nicaragua filed the application in this case on November 26, 2013, after the Pact had ceased to be in force between the parties.
- The critical date for determining the ICJ's jurisdiction over Colombian counterclaims is the date on which the Pact of Bogot ceased to be in force between the parties.
- The ICJ's jurisdiction is limited to claims falling within the scope of the title of jurisdiction and the subject-matter of the dispute presented in Nicaragua's application.
- The Court must determine whether each of Colombia's counterclaims fits within the subject-matter of the dispute presented in Nicaragua's application.
