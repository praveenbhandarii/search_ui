Document Date: November 15, 2017
Key Parties Involved: Nicaragua, Colombia
Case Name: Alleged Violations of Sovereign Rights and Maritime Spaces in the Caribbean Sea (Nicaragua v. Colombia)

Case Summary:
This case involves a dispute between Nicaragua and Colombia regarding alleged violations of Nicaragua's sovereign rights and maritime spaces in the Caribbean Sea. Nicaragua filed an application instituting proceedings against Colombia, claiming that Colombia's actions violated Nicaragua's rights as declared in a previous judgment by the ICJ. Colombia, in turn, filed counterclaims against Nicaragua, alleging violations of its own sovereign rights and maritime spaces. The ICJ issued an order regarding the admissibility of Colombia's counterclaims.

Context:
- Nicaragua filed an application against Colombia, alleging violations of its sovereign rights and maritime zones as declared in a previous ICJ judgment.
- Colombia filed counterclaims against Nicaragua, claiming violations of its own sovereign rights and maritime spaces.
- The ICJ considered the admissibility of Colombia's counterclaims and the direct connection requirement between the counterclaims and Nicaragua's principal claims.
- The ICJ examined the requirements of admissibility under Article 80 of the Rules of Court and found that the requirements are cumulative and must be satisfied for a counterclaim to be found admissible.
- The ICJ concluded that there is a direct connection between Colombia's counterclaims and Nicaragua's principal claims, as they both relate to the scope of the rights and obligations of a coastal State in its Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ).
