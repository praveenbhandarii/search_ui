Case Name: Obligations concerning Negotiations relating to Cessation of the Nuclear Arms Race and to Nuclear Disarmament (Marshall Islands v. India)

Case Summary:
The Republic of the Marshall Islands filed applications against nine states, including India, accusing them of not fulfilling their obligations regarding the cessation of the nuclear arms race and nuclear disarmament. The Marshall Islands requested the ICJ to issue a declaratory judgment finding that India violated its international obligations and to order India to comply with customary international law. India denied the claims made by the Marshall Islands. The ICJ dismissed the case, stating that no dispute existed between the parties prior to the filing of the application.

Context:
- The Marshall Islands alleged that India failed to comply with its obligations under customary international law related to nuclear disarmament.
- The ICJ's judgment was based on the absence of a dispute between the parties prior to the filing of the application.
- Judge Tomka issued a separate opinion, disagreeing with the Court's approach and highlighting the importance of considering subsequent events in determining the existence of a dispute.
- The ICJ's jurisdiction in this case was based on declarations made by both the Marshall Islands and India under Article 36, paragraph 2, of the ICJ Statute.
