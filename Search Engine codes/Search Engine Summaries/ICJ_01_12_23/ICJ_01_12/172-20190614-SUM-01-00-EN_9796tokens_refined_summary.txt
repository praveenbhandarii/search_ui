Case ID: ICJ/172
Court/Tribunal: International Court of Justice (ICJ)
Document Date: 2019/06/14
Key Parties Involved: Qatar, United Arab Emirates (UAE)
Case Name: Application of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (Qatar v. United Arab Emirates)

Case Summary:
Qatar instituted proceedings against the UAE on 11 June 2018, alleging violations of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (CERD). The case involves issues related to human rights, the CERD Convention, and the jurisdiction of the ICJ. The ICJ has issued orders and received requests for provisional measures from both parties. The court rejected the UAE's request for provisional measures, stating that the requested measures were not necessary to preserve the rights of the parties.

Context:
- The ICJ has consistently treated measures of nonaggravation as ancillary to measures for preserving specific rights.
- Judge Canado Trindade delivered a separate opinion emphasizing the importance of the principle of equality and nondiscrimination in international law.
- The UAE's request for provisional measures did not establish a link between the rights sought to be protected and the measures requested.
- The ICJ's previous order of 23 July 2018 remains in force, protecting certain rights under the CERD Convention.
- The principle of equality and nondiscrimination has received more attention in previous proceedings related to Qatar's request than in the current proceedings related to the UAE's request.
