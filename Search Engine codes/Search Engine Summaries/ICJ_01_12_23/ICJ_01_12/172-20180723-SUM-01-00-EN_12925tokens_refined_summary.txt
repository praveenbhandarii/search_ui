Document Date: 2018
Key Parties Involved: Qatar, United Arab Emirates (UAE)
Case Name: Application of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (Qatar v. United Arab Emirates)

Case Summary:
Qatar instituted proceedings against the UAE, alleging violations of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (CERD). Qatar claims that the UAE has enacted discriminatory measures against Qataris based on their national origin, violating their rights under CERD. The ICJ found that some of the rights asserted by Qatar are plausible and that there is a link between the rights claimed and the provisional measures requested. The ICJ indicated provisional measures to protect the rights of Qataris, including reunification of families, education opportunities for affected students, access to justice, and refraining from actions that could aggravate the dispute.

Context:
- Qatar alleges violations of CERD by the UAE

- Qatar asserts rights to marriage, education, access to justice, and freedom of movement
- Measures adopted by the UAE appear to target only Qataris and not other non-citizens
- Obligations of States parties under CERD include eliminating racial discrimination and protecting individuals from discrimination
