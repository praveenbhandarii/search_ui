Case Name: Obligations concerning Negotiations relating to Cessation of the Nuclear Arms Race and to Nuclear Disarmament (Marshall Islands v. India)

Case Summary:
The Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI) filed an application against India, along with eight other states, accusing them of not fulfilling their obligations regarding the cessation of the nuclear arms race and nuclear disarmament. The RMI alleged that India had failed to comply with its obligations under customary international law to pursue negotiations leading to nuclear disarmament in good faith.

Context:

- The NPT recognizes an obligation to negotiate in good faith for nuclear disarmament.
- The case raises issues related to the definition of a "dispute" between states, criteria for determining the existence of a dispute, and the importance of nuclear disarmament to the international community.
