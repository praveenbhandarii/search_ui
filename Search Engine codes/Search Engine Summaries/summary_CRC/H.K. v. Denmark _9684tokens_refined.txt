Case Details:

- Court/Tribunal: United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC)
- Document Date: 28 October 2022
- Key Parties Involved:
  - Author: H.K. (represented by counsel, Julia Jensen)
  - State party: S.K. (Denmark)
- Case Name: H.K. v. S.K.
- Case Summary: The author, H.K., a national of India, submitted a communication to the UNCRC claiming that her daughter, S.K., would face a violation of her rights under articles 3 and 22 of the Convention if they were to be deported to India. The author alleges that her daughter would face a risk of violence from her father and that the State party's refusal to grant them asylum would violate their rights under the Convention.

Procedural History:
The case involves the denial of asylum to H.K. and her daughter, S.K., by the Danish Immigration Service and the Refugee Appeals Board. The author challenged the decision before the UNCRC, alleging violations of articles 3 and 22 of the Convention.

Legal Analysis and Reasoning:
The Committee on the Rights of the Child considered the communication under the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child. The Committee examined whether the State party's decision to deny asylum violated articles 3, 6, 22, and 37(a) of the Convention. The Committee found that the State party had failed to adequately consider H.K.'s and S.K.'s asylum claims, particularly in light of the alleged risks they faced in India.

Decisions and Rulings:
The Committee found that H.K.'s claims of domestic violence and abuse were credible and that the State party had not fulfilled its obligations under article 22 of the Convention by providing appropriate protection and humanitarian assistance to H.K. and S.K.

Impact and Significance:
This case highlights the importance of considering the rights of children in asylum proceedings and the need for States to provide appropriate protection and humanitarian assistance to victims of domestic violence and abuse, particularly in cases where the perpetrator is a family member.
