Summary:

Case Details:
- Case ID: CRC/C/85/D/111/2020
- Court/Tribunal: United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC)
- Document Date: 2020
- Key Parties Involved: N.S. (alleged victim), State party (Spain)
- Case Name: N.S. v. Spain
- Case Summary: N.S., a 12-year-old girl of Moroccan nationality born in Melilla, Spain, claimed a violation of her rights under articles 23 and 28 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child due to the authorities' failure to enroll her in school despite her being a resident of Melilla.

Procedural History:
The communication was submitted by N.S. (through her mother, A.B.) on 10 February 2020. The Committee requested interim measures to enroll N.S. in school while the communication was under consideration. The State party initially rejected the request, but later confirmed that N.S. had been enrolled in school.

Legal Analysis and Reasoning:
The CRC Committee found that the State party's failure to respond to N.S.'s application for enrollment in school and the subsequent rejection of her application constituted a violation of her right to education. The Committee also emphasized the best interests of the child as a fundamental principle of the CRC.

Decisions and Rulings:
The Committee decided to discontinue its consideration of the communication as N.S.'s enrolment in school left the present communication bereft of purpose.

Impact and Significance:
This decision highlights the importance of ensuring that children have access to education without discrimination and emphasizes the principle of the best interests of the child. It has implications for the protection of the rights of migrant children, particularly those who are irregular residents, and underscores the obligation of States parties to ensure access to education and other basic rights regardless of migration status.
