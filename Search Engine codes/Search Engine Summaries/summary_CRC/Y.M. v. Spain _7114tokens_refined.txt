Summary:

Case Details:
- Case ID: CRC/C/78/D/8/2016
- Court/Tribunal: United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC)
- Document Date: 2018
- Key Parties Involved: Y.M. (represented by counsel, Albert Pars Casanova) vs. Spain
- Case Name: Y.M. v. Spain
- Case Summary: Y.M., an Algerian citizen, claims to have been born on 9 December 1999 and alleges violations of his rights under articles 3, 8, 12, 18 (2), 20, 27 and 29 of the Convention. The Committee considered the communication under the Optional Protocol and requested that Spain refrain from returning the author to his country of origin and transfer him to a child protection centre while his case was under consideration.

Procedural History:
The Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on a communications procedure entered into force for Spain on 14 April 2014. The Working Group on Communications, acting on behalf of the Committee, requested that Spain refrain from returning the author to his country of origin and transfer him to a child protection centre while his case was under consideration by the Committee.

Legal Analysis and Reasoning:
The main issues in this case are the determination of the age of an alleged unaccompanied minor and violations of rights under the Convention on the Rights of the Child. The Committee must consider whether the medical tests used to determine Y.M.'s age were reliable and whether they were conducted in accordance with the Convention's requirements. The case also raises the issue of whether Y.M. has exhausted all available domestic remedies.

Decisions and Rulings:
The Committee found that the laissez-passer issued by the Algerian consulate in Barcelona, which showed the author's date of birth as December 9, 1997, was a valid document that proved the author was an adult at the time of his arrival in Spain. Therefore, the Committee considered the complaint inadmissible under Article 7(c) of the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child.

Impact and Significance:
This case has important implications for the treatment of unaccompanied minors and the determination of their age. It highlights the need for States parties to ensure that unaccompanied minors are treated in accordance with their best interests and that they are provided with appropriate protection and care.
