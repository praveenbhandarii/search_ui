- Case Summary: D.D., a Malian citizen, alleged violations of articles 3, 20, and 37 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child by Spain, including procedural issues (summary deportation) and substantive issues (failure to exhaust domestic remedies, inadmissibility rationae loci, rationae personae and rationae materiae).

Procedural History:
The communication was submitted by D.D. (represented by counsel, Mr. Carsten Gericke, and by Fundación Raíces, a non-governmental organization) to the UNCRC on November 26, 2015. The UNCRC adopted its views on the case on February 1, 2019, finding the communication admissible under the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child.

Legal Analysis and Reasoning:
The UNCRC found that Spain violated D.D.'s rights under the CRC by summarily deporting him to Morocco without considering his age, identity, or personal circumstances. The Committee also found that Spain's actions were in breach of its obligations under the CRC, specifically Article 3 (best interests of the child), Article 20 (protection from economic exploitation), and Article 37 (protection from torture and ill-treatment).

Decisions and Rulings:
The UNCRC ruled in favor of D.D., finding Spain in violation of the CRC for the summary deportation of an unaccompanied child and the failure to provide effective domestic remedies.

Impact and Significance:
This case has significant implications for the treatment of unaccompanied children and the obligations of States parties under the CRC. It emphasizes the importance of protecting the rights of unaccompanied children and ensuring that they are treated in accordance with their best interests. The decision serves as a reminder to states parties of their obligations under the CRC.
