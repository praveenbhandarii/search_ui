- Case Name: M.A.B. v. Spain
- Case Summary: M.A.B., a Guinean citizen, was intercepted by the Spanish national police while attempting to enter Spain illegally. He claimed to be a minor, but the authorities did not take his assertion into account and instead ordered him to be placed in a holding centre for foreign nationals in Barcelona for a period of no more than 60 days, pending his expulsion. M.A.B. maintained that he was never notified of any medical age determination tests, and he contacted lawyers at the holding centre who requested information about the tests. The author claims that the State party failed to take into account the best interests of the child, as required by article 3 of the Convention, during the age determination procedure.

Procedural History:
The case was submitted to the Committee on the Rights of the Child by M.A.B., who alleged violations of articles 3, 8, 12, 18(2), 20(1), 27, and 29 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child by Spain. The State party's observations were submitted on 27 October 2017. The Committee considered the admissibility of the complaint and found that M.A.B.'s claims under articles 3, 8, and 12 of the Convention were admissible.

Legal Analysis and Reasoning:
The main issues in the case revolve around the failure of the State party to take into account the best interests of the child during the age determination procedure, as required by the Convention. The author's claims under articles 3, 8, and 12 of the Convention were found to be admissible by the Committee. The Committee emphasized the importance of ensuring that the age determination process for unaccompanied minors is fair, transparent, and takes into account the best interests of the child.

Decisions and Rulings:
The Committee found that Spain had violated the author's rights under articles 3, 8, and 12 of the Convention. The State party was found to have failed to ensure that the age determination process was fair, transparent, and took into account the best interests of the child.

Impact and Significance:
This decision has significant implications for the treatment of unaccompanied migrant children in Spain and beyond. It emphasizes the need for the State party to ensure that the age determination process is carried out in a manner that respects the rights of the child and that unaccompanied minors are provided with adequate protection and assistance during this process.
