Procedural History:
- Date of communication: 6 April 2019

- The Committee considered the case moot and discontinued the consideration of communication No. 82/2019 in accordance with rule 26 of its rules of procedure.

Legal Analysis and Reasoning:
- The CRC Committee considered the communication to be inadmissible due to the author's failure to exhaust domestic remedies.
- The State party, Germany, argued that the author had an appeal pending before the Federal Constitutional Court, and thus, the complaint should be declared inadmissible.
- The Committee also noted that the author's claims had been assessed by German authorities, which found that it had not been substantiated that the author or his mother would be at risk of inhuman or degrading treatment if returned to Sweden.

Decisions and Rulings:
- The Committee considered the case moot and discontinued the consideration of communication No. 82/2019 in accordance with rule 26 of its rules of procedure.

Impact and Significance:
- This case highlights the importance of ensuring that children's rights are protected when they are facing deportation or return to a country where they may not have access to necessary medical care. It also underscores the importance of exhausting domestic remedies before submitting a complaint to an international human rights body.
