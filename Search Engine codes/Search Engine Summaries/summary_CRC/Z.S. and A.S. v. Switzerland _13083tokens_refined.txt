- Case Name: Z.S. and A.S. v. Switzerland
- Case Summary: The authors, Z.S. and A.S., both Russian nationals from Chechnya, submitted a communication to the UNCRC alleging that Switzerland had violated their rights and the rights of their children, K.S. and M.S., under various articles of the Convention on the Rights of the Child.

Procedural History:
The communication was initially submitted on 20 September 2018. The views were adopted by the Committee on 10 February 2022. The key parties involved were Z.S. and A.S. as the authors, represented by counsel Klausfranz RstHehli, and Switzerland as the state party. The jurisdiction and competence of the UNCRC were invoked to address the alleged violations of the Convention on the Rights of the Child.

Legal Analysis and Reasoning:
The authors alleged violations of various articles of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, including the denial of asylum, lack of access to schooling and public social assistance, and failure to consider their daughter's need for a cochlear implant. The main issues addressed were the denial of asylum, lack of access to education and social security, and the failure to provide appropriate medical care for the daughter's disability. The authors argued that these actions violated their children's rights under the Convention.

Decisions and Rulings:
The Committee found that Switzerland had violated the rights of the children under the Convention on the Rights of the Child. Specifically, the State party was found to have failed to provide adequate protection and support for the children, leading to violations of their rights to education, health, and non-discrimination.

Impact and Significance:
This case sets a precedent for the protection of the rights of children in migration and asylum procedures. It emphasizes the importance of considering the best interests of the child and ensuring access to education, social security, and appropriate medical care, regardless of immigration status.
