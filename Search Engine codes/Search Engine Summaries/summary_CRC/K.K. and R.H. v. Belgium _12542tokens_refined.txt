  - A.M.K. and S.K. (the state party)
- Case Name: K.K. and R.H. v. A.M.K. and S.K.

Procedural History:
The authors, K.K. and R.H., submitted a communication on behalf of their two daughters, A.M.K. and S.K., to the UNCRC. The communication raised concerns about the detention and potential deportation of the family from Belgium. The communication was initially submitted on 30 January 2019, and the Views were adopted on 4 February 2022.

Legal Analysis and Reasoning:
The authors argued that the detention and potential deportation of their children would violate their rights under the Convention on the Rights of the Child, specifically articles 3, 24, 27, 28, 29, 31, and 37. They contended that the detention and deportation would be a violation of the children's rights to freedom, education, health, and family unity. The State party argued that the detention and deportation were necessary and proportionate due to the family's irregular migratory status.

Decisions and Rulings:
The UNCRC found the communication admissible and declared that the detention of the children constituted a violation of their rights under the Convention on the Rights of the Child. The Committee specified that the detention was not a measure of last resort and failed to consider the best interests of the children.

Impact and Significance:
This case sets a precedent for the treatment of migrant children and the use of detention as a measure of first resort. It emphasizes the importance of considering the best interests of the child in all decisions related to their detention and deportation.
