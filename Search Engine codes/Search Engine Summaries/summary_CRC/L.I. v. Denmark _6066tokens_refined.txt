Summary:

Case Details:
- Case ID: CRC/C/85/D/49/2018
- Court/Tribunal: United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC)
- Document Date: 2020
- Key Parties Involved: L.I. (the author and victim) and State party: B.I. Denmark
- Case Name: L.I. v. Denmark
- Case Summary: L.I., a national of North Macedonia, submitted a communication to the UNCRC claiming that the deportation of her daughter, B.I., to North Macedonia would violate her daughter's rights under articles 2, 3, 6, 7 and 8 of the Convention.

Procedural History:
The author, L.I., entered Denmark on 4 February 2015 as part of a family reunification program. She reported an incident of attempted harm to her daughter and applied for asylum, which was rejected. The author and B.I. were not given the right to appeal the decision to the Danish Refugee Appeals Board.

Legal Analysis and Reasoning:
The main issues in this case are whether the deportation of the child would violate her rights under the Convention, the fairness of the asylum process, and the risk of harm linked to gender or cultural norms. The author argues that the Danish authorities failed to properly assess the risk that her daughter would face if returned to North Macedonia.

Decisions and Rulings:
The Committee found that the deportation of B.I. to North Macedonia would put her at risk of irreparable harm, including honor killing, and that the Danish authorities failed to properly assess her individual reasons for asylum. The Committee considered the communication admissible under the Optional Protocol.

Impact and Significance:
This case highlights the importance of protecting the rights of children in the context of migration and asylum policies. It also emphasizes the need for fair and thorough assessments of asylum claims, especially in cases where the risk of harm is linked to gender or cultural norms.
