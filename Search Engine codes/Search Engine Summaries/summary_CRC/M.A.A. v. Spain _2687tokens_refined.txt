- Court/Tribunal: United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC)
- Document Date: 2016
- Key Parties Involved: A.A.A. (author and aunt of U.A.I.) vs. Spain (State party)
- Case Name: A.A.A. v. Spain
- Case Summary: A.A.A., a Spanish national, submitted a communication to the UNCRC claiming that Spain had violated the rights of her niece, U.A.I., under articles 3, 13, 14, 16 and 39 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, by denying her request for visitation with her niece and failing to protect her from emotional abuse by her parents.

Procedural History:
The communication was submitted on 5 October 2015. The Committee considered the admissibility of the communication under the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child.

Legal Analysis and Reasoning:
The main issue was whether the State party's courts violated U.A.I.'s rights under the Convention by denying A.A.A.'s application for a visitation schedule and allowing U.A.I.'s parents to isolate her from her father's family. The Committee found that the State party had violated U.A.I.'s rights under articles 3, 13, 14, and 16 of the Convention.

Decisions and Rulings:
The Committee held that the State party's courts had failed to take into account the child's best interests when they rejected A.A.A.'s application for a visitation schedule, and had instead prioritized the parents' interests over those of the child. The State party had also violated U.A.I.'s right to freedom of expression and association by allowing her parents to isolate her from her father's family.

Impact and Significance:
This decision emphasizes the importance of protecting the rights of children under the Convention and highlights the need to prioritize the best interests of the child in all decisions affecting them. It also underscores the importance of ensuring that children are able to maintain relationships with both sides of their family, as long as it is in their best interests.
