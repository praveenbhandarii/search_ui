Context Summary:
This case concerns the deportation of two authors from a State party to the Convention on the Rights of the Child. The authors claim that they were not assisted by a specialist in the age determination process and that they did not have a lawyer present during the procedure. The use of panoramic dental X-rays to determine age is a controversial practice that has been criticized by human rights organizations. The State party's failure to provide a specialist in the age determination process and the lack of legal representation for the authors during the procedure may constitute a violation of their rights under the Convention.

Legal Analysis and Reasoning:
The main issues in the case include whether the State party violated the authors' rights under the Convention on the Rights of the Child by failing to provide a specialist in the age determination process and by not having a lawyer present during the procedure. The use of panoramic dental X-rays to determine age is also questioned.

Decisions and Rulings:
The Committee discontinued its consideration of the communications after the authors' lawyers notified them that they had lost contact with the authors and did not know their whereabouts.

Impact and Significance:
This case raises questions about the use of controversial methods, such as panoramic dental X-rays, to determine age in immigration proceedings. The outcome of this case could have implications for the treatment of migrant children in the future and may influence the development of policies and practices related to age determination in immigration cases.
