Summary:

Case Details:
- Case ID: CRC/C/89/D/50/2018
- Court/Tribunal: United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC)
- Document Date: 2022
- Key Parties Involved: T.E.A. (represented by counsel, Mr. Albert Casanova Pars) vs. Spain
- Case Name: T.E.A. v. Spain
- Case Summary: T.E.A., a Moroccan national, alleges that Spain violated his rights under articles 3, 8, 12, 20, 27, and 29 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child by conducting an age assessment procedure without his consent, failing to provide him with a guardian, and detaining him in a center for adult migrants.

Procedural History:
The communication was submitted by T.E.A. under the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on a communications procedure. The case was initially submitted on 3 August 2018. The Optional Protocol entered into force for Spain on April 14, 2014.

Legal Analysis and Reasoning:
The main issue in this case is whether Spain violated T.E.A.'s rights under the CRC by detaining him in a center for adult migrants, failing to provide him with adequate legal representation, and ignoring his claims of being a minor. T.E.A. argues that Spain failed to ensure his best interests were considered, as required under article 3 of the CRC, and that he was denied his rights to identity, development, and special protection and assistance from the State.

Decisions and Rulings:
The CRC Committee requested Spain to adopt interim measures, such as staying the enforcement of T.E.A.'s deportation order and transferring him to a child protection center. However, despite subsequent attempts by the secretariat to contact T.E.A.'s counsel, no information has been received on his current whereabouts.

Impact and Significance:
This case highlights the importance of protecting the rights of unaccompanied minors who are seeking asylum or are migrants. It emphasizes the need for States to ensure that these children are treated in accordance with their rights under the CRC, particularly their right to be heard, right to a guardian, and right to special protection and assistance from the State. The case also underscores the significance of providing adequate legal representation to unaccompanied minors in migration proceedings.
