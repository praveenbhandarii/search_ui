Case Details:
- Case ID: CRC/C/85/D/53/2018
- Court/Tribunal: United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC)
- Document Date: 28 October 2020
- Key Parties Involved: J.A. and E.A. (represented by counsel, Klausfranz RstHehli) vs. Switzerland
- Case Name: J.A. and E.A. v. Switzerland
- Case Summary: The authors, J.A. and E.A., are Nigerian nationals who entered Switzerland illegally in 2008. They claim that their rights under the Convention on the Rights of the Child were violated by Switzerland when they were ordered to be removed from the country. The authors submit that their child, E.A., who was born in Switzerland, would face a risk of harm if he were returned to Nigeria.

Procedural History:
The case involves a Nigerian family consisting of a mother (J.A.) and her two children (E.A. and V.N.A.), who were residing in Switzerland. The family was facing deportation after their asylum application was rejected, and the mother was accused of neglecting her children's education and upbringing. The case worker from the Child and Adult Protection Authority in Dbendorf recommended that the family should not be separated and that the children should remain with their mother. However, the State Secretariat for Migration dismissed the request for entry visas for the children and their mother, citing the lack of jurisdiction over E.A. as he was outside the country.

Legal Analysis and Reasoning:
The authors argue that the State party violated their rights under the Convention on the Rights of the Child, specifically articles 12, 11, 20, and 8(2). They claim that the State party has failed to protect their rights to family unity, education, and an adequate standard of living. The authors also argue that the State party's decision to dismiss their request for entry visas was based on a flawed interpretation of the Convention and disregarded the best interests of the children.

Decisions and Rulings:
The State party challenges the admissibility of the communication on several grounds, including ratione personae, ratione temporis, and non-exhaustion of domestic remedies. The State party argues that J.A. is not a child within the meaning of the Convention since she had reached the age of majority, and that the powers of attorney submitted by the authors' counsel are invalid. The State party also argues that the authors have failed to exhaust available domestic remedies.

Impact and Significance:
This case raises important questions about the protection of the rights of children in the context of migration and asylum proceedings. It highlights the need for States to ensure that children are protected from inhuman treatment and discrimination, and that their best interests are taken into account in all decisions affecting them.
