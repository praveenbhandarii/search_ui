Summary:

Case Details:
- Case ID: CRC/C/93/D/192/2022
- Court/Tribunal: United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC)
- Document Date: 8 June 2023
- Key Parties Involved:
  - S.S.S. (the author and victim, represented by counsel, Karine Povlakic and Stefano Agostini)
  - State party: Switzerland
- Case Name: S.S.S. v. Switzerland
- Case Summary: S.S.S., a national of Ethiopia, and his permanently disabled father applied for family reunification with their mother and two sisters, who resided in Saudi Arabia. The State party rejected their application, and S.S.S. submitted a communication to the UNCRC claiming a violation of his rights under Article 3 of the Convention.

Procedural History:
The communication was submitted on 7 July 2022, and the Committee discontinued its consideration of the communication in accordance with Rule 26 of its rules of procedure under the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on a communications procedure.

Legal Analysis and Reasoning:
The main issue in this case is whether the Swiss authorities' refusal to grant S.S.S.'s application for family reunification violates his rights under Article 3 of the Convention. The Committee found that the author's complaint related materially to the guarantees of Article 10(1) of the Convention, which deals with the right to family unity. The Committee noted that the State party had entered a reservation to Article 10(1) of the Convention, but found that the author's complaint challenged the State party's rules on family reunification and that a reservation relating to a specific provision cannot be circumvented by invoking a provision of a general nature, such as Article 3 of the Convention.

Decisions and Rulings:
The Committee found that the communication was admissible and that the State party's refusal to grant S.S.S.'s application for family reunification violated his rights under Article 10(1) of the Convention.

Impact and Significance:
This decision is relevant to the interpretation and application of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, particularly with regard to the right to family unity. It highlights the importance of considering the interplay between different provisions of the Convention and the potential impact of reservations entered by State parties.
