  - H.B. (represented by counsel, Vanessa Hernandez Delgado)
  - Spain
- Case Name: H.B. v. Spain
- Case Summary: H.B., a Moroccan national aged 15 at the time of submission of the communication, claims that Spain violated his rights under articles 3, 8, 18 (2), 20, 27 and 29 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child. He was detained by the Civil Guard of Arrecife and later transferred to a shelter, where he was subjected to medical tests that declared him to be an adult. H.B. alleges that he was not notified of the results of these tests and that he did not have a lawyer present during the procedure.

Procedural History:
The communication was submitted under the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child. The Committee on the Rights of the Child considered the communication and made findings and recommendations under the CRC.

Legal Analysis and Reasoning:
The main issue in this case is whether H.B.'s rights under the CRC were violated when the Spanish authorities declared him to be an adult and detained him for removal from the country. The Committee found that H.B.'s rights under the CRC were violated when the Spanish authorities failed to properly determine his age and treated him as an adult without proper medical evidence.

Decisions and Rulings:
The Committee found that H.B.'s rights under the CRC were violated and made recommendations for the protection of children's rights worldwide.

Impact and Significance:
This decision is relevant to the implementation of the CRC and the protection of children's rights worldwide. It highlights the importance of proper age determination procedures and the need for states to ensure that children are treated in accordance with their rights under the CRC.
