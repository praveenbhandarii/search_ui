- Case Summary: The authors, who were minors at the time of submission of the communications, claim that the State party has violated their rights under articles 3, 8, 18 (2), 20, 27 and 29 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child. They were detained by the Maritime Safety and Rescue Agency and the National Police in October 2018, and were later declared to be adults based on medical tests. The authors allege that these tests were conducted without their consent and without the presence of an interpreter, and that they did not have a lawyer present during the procedure. They also claim that the State party failed to provide them with adequate protection and assistance as unaccompanied minors.

Procedural History:
The authors, represented by counsel, submitted communications No. 70/2019, No. 71/2019, and No. 72/2019 to the Committee on the Rights of the Child under the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on a communications procedure. The initial submissions were made on 3 December 2018 (70/2019 and 72/2019) and 21 January 2019 (71/2019).

Legal Analysis and Reasoning:
The case raises legal issues related to the violation of the rights of the authors under the Convention on the Rights of the Child, including the right to be protected from economic exploitation, the right to education, and the right to appropriate care and protection as minors. The authors argue that the State party failed to comply with several provisions of the Convention, including the right to an identity, the right to be heard, the right to a guardian, the right to development, and the right to special protection and assistance from the State.

Decisions and Rulings:
The Committee will need to make a decision on whether the State party violated the rights of the authors under the Convention on the Rights of the Child. The decision could have implications for the treatment of unaccompanied minor migrants in other countries and may serve as guidance for States parties in implementing the Convention.

Impact and Significance:
This case highlights the importance of protecting the rights of unaccompanied minor migrants and ensuring that they receive appropriate care and protection. It also emphasizes the need for States parties to have adequate procedures in place for determining the age of minors and providing them with appropriate care and protection.
