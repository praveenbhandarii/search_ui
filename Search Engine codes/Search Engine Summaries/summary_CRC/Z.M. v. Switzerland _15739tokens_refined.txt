Summary:

Case Details:
- Case ID: CRC/C/92/D/101/2019
- Court/Tribunal: United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC)
- Document Date: 21 February 2023
- Key Parties Involved: Z.M. (the author and victim) vs. Switzerland (the state party)
- Case Name: Z.M. v. Switzerland

Procedural History:
The case involves a complaint submitted to the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child (CRC) by Z.M., a Russian national, and her three children seeking asylum in Switzerland. They were initially denied asylum and ordered to be transferred to Austria under the Dublin III Regulation. Z.M. challenged this decision, citing the risk of inhuman and degrading treatment due to her severe depression and her children's mental and physical health issues. The Federal Administrative Court rejected their appeal, leading the family to bring their case before the European Court of Human Rights.

Legal Analysis and Reasoning:
The case raises several legal issues related to asylum procedures, protection against gender-based violence, and the rights of children. Z.M. argues that the removal order violates her and her children's rights under the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) and the Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CAT). The main issues in this case are whether the removal order violates the author's and her children's rights under the ECHR and CAT, and whether the Federal Administrative Court failed to properly consider these rights when issuing the removal order.

Decisions and Rulings:
The Committee on the Rights of the Child (the Committee) considered the communication under the Optional Protocol to the CRC on a communications procedure. The Committee held that the author's claims were admissible and proceeded to examine the merits of the case. The Committee found that the removal of the family to Austria would violate their rights under the Convention on the Rights of the Child, particularly in regards to the best interests of the child and protection from inhuman or degrading treatment.

Impact and Significance:
This decision highlights the importance of considering the best interests of the child in asylum proceedings and raises questions about the responsibility of EU member states to ensure the safety and well-being of asylum seekers. It also underscores the need for States to provide adequate protection and humanitarian assistance to refugee children and to ensure that they have access to adequate medical care.
