- Court/Tribunal: United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC)
- Document Date: 2021
- Key Parties Involved:
  - H.M. (the author and victim)
  - Spain (the state party)
- Case Name: H.M. v. Spain

Procedural History:
The case involves a communication submitted by H.M. on behalf of her son, A.E.A., to the UNCRC, alleging violations of their rights under the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) due to the denial of A.E.A.'s right to education in Spain. The communication was submitted on March 8, 2020, and the UNCRC adopted its views on the communication on May 31, 2021.

Legal Analysis and Reasoning:
The main issues in the case revolve around the denial of A.E.A.'s enrollment in a school in Melilla, Spain, based on his irregular administrative status. The author alleges violations of articles 2, 3, 14, 28, and 29 of the CRC, particularly related to discrimination, best interests of the child, and the right to education. The State party's failure to comply with the Committee's requests for interim measures is also a key issue.

Decisions and Rulings:
The Committee found that Spain violated A.E.A.'s rights under articles 3(1) and 28 of the CRC, read in conjunction with article 6 of the Optional Protocol. The Committee held that Spain's refusal to enroll A.E.A. based on his irregular administrative status constituted discrimination and that Spain's failure to comply with the Committee's requests for interim measures was a violation of the Optional Protocol.

Impact and Significance:
This decision highlights the importance of ensuring access to education for all children, regardless of their administrative status. It emphasizes the obligation of States parties to the CRC to take all appropriate measures to ensure the protection of children's rights, including the right to education. The decision also underscores the role of the Committee on the Rights of the Child in monitoring and enforcing the implementation of the CRC and the Optional Protocol.
