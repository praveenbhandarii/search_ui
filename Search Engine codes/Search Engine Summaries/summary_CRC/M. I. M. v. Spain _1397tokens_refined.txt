Case Details:
- Case ID: CRC/C/82/D/54/2018
- Court/Tribunal: United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC)
- Document Date: 2019
- Key Parties Involved: M.I.M. (author) vs. Spain (State party)
- Case Name: M.I.M. v. Spain
- Case Summary: M.I.M., a national of Algeria, was intercepted on a small boat near the Spanish coast and was taken to a hospital for an X-ray age determination test, which showed that he was between 18 and 19 years old. He was then transferred to a holding center for adult foreign nationals and later requested to be recognized as a minor. The Working Group on Communications registered the communication and requested that Spain suspend the expulsion of M.I.M. and transfer him to a child protection center. Spain later confirmed that M.I.M. was a minor and transferred him to a juvenile prosecution service.

Procedural History:
The communication was submitted by M.I.M. on 24 September 2018, under Article 24 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC). The main procedural issue was the recognition of M.I.M.'s status as a minor and his rights under the CRC. The substantive issue was the violation of M.I.M.'s rights under Article 24 of the CRC, including the right to have his best interests taken into consideration and the right to be protected from economic exploitation and abuse.

Legal Analysis and Reasoning:
The main legal issue in this case was whether Spain violated the author's rights under the Convention on the Rights of the Child by subjecting him to a medical age-determination test without legal counsel or proper procedures. The author argued that his best interests were not taken into consideration during the age-determination procedure.

Decisions and Rulings:
The Committee on the Rights of the Child considered the request for discontinuance made by Spain and observed that M.I.M.'s status as a minor had been recognized and that he had been placed under the protection of the authorities. The Committee decided to discontinue the consideration of communication No. 54/2018, in accordance with rule 26 of its rules of procedure under the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on a communications procedure.

Impact and Significance:
This case highlights the importance of protecting the rights of unaccompanied child migrants and ensuring that they are treated in accordance with the Convention on the Rights of the Child. It sets an important precedent for future cases involving the rights of unaccompanied child migrants.
