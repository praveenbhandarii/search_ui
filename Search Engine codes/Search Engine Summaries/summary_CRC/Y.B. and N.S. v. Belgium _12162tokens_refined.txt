- Case Summary: The authors, Y.B. and N.S., submitted a communication to the UNCRC on behalf of C.E., a Moroccan national born in 2011, alleging violations of the Convention on the Rights of the Child.

Procedural History:
The case involves a complaint filed by Y.B. and N.S., a Belgian-Moroccan couple, against the Belgian State, alleging violations of the Convention on the Rights of the Child in relation to their application for a long-stay visa for their foster child, C.E. The authors claimed that C.E. was denied a humanitarian visa to enter Belgium, where she was taken in under a kafalah (fostering arrangement) by the authors.

Legal Analysis and Reasoning:
The authors argued that the denial of a long-stay visa for C.E. violated articles 2, 3, 10, 12, and 20 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child. They also argued that the denial of the visa was a form of discrimination based on ethnicity.

Decisions and Rulings:
The Committee found that the State party violated articles 3, 10, and 12 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child by failing to consider the child's best interests and not allowing her the right to be heard. The State party was also required to take measures to prevent similar violations from occurring in the future.

Impact and Significance:
This decision has implications for the protection of children's rights and the responsibility of States to ensure that those rights are protected. It highlights the importance of considering the best interests of the child in any decision-making process related to their rights.
