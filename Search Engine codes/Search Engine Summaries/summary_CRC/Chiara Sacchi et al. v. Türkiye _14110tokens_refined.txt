- Case Summary: The authors, represented by counsel, allege that Turkey's failure to prevent and mitigate the consequences of climate change violates their rights under the Convention on the Rights of the Child.

Procedural History:
The authors, represented by counsel, filed a communication with the UNCRC alleging that Turkey's actions and omissions regarding climate change have violated their rights. The State party submitted observations on the admissibility and merits of the complaint, challenging the jurisdiction of the Committee and the exhaustion of domestic remedies.

Legal Analysis and Reasoning:
The authors relied on various provisions of the Convention on the Rights of the Child to support their claims, including Articles 3, 6, 24, and 30. They argued that Turkey's failures to address the climate crisis constitute a violation of their rights to life, health, and the prioritization of the best interests of the child, as well as the cultural rights of indigenous children. The State party argued that the communication should be found inadmissible for lack of jurisdiction, failure to exhaust domestic remedies, and lack of substantiation of the claims for purposes of admissibility.

Decisions and Rulings:
The Committee found the communication admissible, recognizing the authors' claims and the State party's obligations under the Convention. The Committee emphasized the importance of considering the best interests of the child in decision-making processes related to the climate crisis.

Impact and Significance:
This case sets a precedent for addressing the responsibility of states for their contributions to climate change and the protection of children's rights in the context of environmental harm. It highlights the urgent need for states to take appropriate measures to address the climate crisis and ensure the enjoyment of children's rights for posterity.
