- Case Summary: The authors, two girls and a boy of Argentine nationality, submitted a communication to the UNCRC claiming that their rights under the Convention on the Rights of the Child were violated when their mother, a Peruvian national, was deported from Argentina.

Procedural History:
The communication was submitted under the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on a communications procedure. The State party later informed the Committee that the National Migration Directorate had decided to definitively suspend the deportation of the complainants' mother and granted her permanent resident status in the country. The Committee confirmed the discontinuance of the communication.

Legal Analysis and Reasoning:
The Committee found that the authors' rights under the CRC were violated during the administrative and judicial proceedings leading to their mother's deportation. The Committee also found that the communication was not inadmissible under Article 17 of the CRC.

Decisions and Rulings:
The Committee requested interim measures in the form of a suspension of the deportation of the authors' mother while the case was under consideration. The State party complied with the request and later granted the mother permanent resident status, leading to the discontinuance of the communication.

Impact and Significance:
This case highlights the importance of considering the best interests of the child in all administrative and judicial proceedings affecting them. It also emphasizes the need for States parties to ensure that children are given the opportunity to express their views and have their opinions taken into account in accordance with their age and maturity.
