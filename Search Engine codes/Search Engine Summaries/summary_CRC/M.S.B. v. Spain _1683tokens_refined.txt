Summary:

Case Details:
- Case ID: CRC/C/90/D/20/2017
- Court/Tribunal: United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC)
- Document Date: 2023
- Key Parties Involved: M.S.B. (represented by the non-governmental organization Fundación Races) vs. Spain
- Case Name: M.S.B. v. Spain
- Case Summary: M.S.B., a national of Guinea, claimed that Spain violated his rights under articles 3, 8, 12, 18(1), and 20(1) of the Convention on the Rights of the Child regarding the assessment of his age and subsequent request for interim measures to prevent his deportation from Spain.

Procedural History:
The author arrived in Spain as an unaccompanied minor, submitted his documents, underwent an age assessment, and requested interim measures to prevent deportation. The UNCRC requested Spain to adopt interim measures, and the author's actual age was eventually recognized by the State party's judicial authorities.

Legal Analysis and Reasoning:
The main issue was whether Spain violated M.S.B.'s rights under the CRC by subjecting him to an age assessment procedure that was not in line with the Convention's provisions. The author argued that he was pressured into undergoing medical tests to assess his age, which violated his right to be heard and his right to special protection and assistance from the State.

Decisions and Rulings:
The Committee found that the communication was not manifestly ill-founded and rejected Spain's request to consider the admissibility and merits of the communication separately. The Committee also emphasized the need for States to ensure that age assessment procedures for unaccompanied minors are carried out in accordance with the CRC's provisions.

Impact and Significance:
This case highlights the importance of ensuring that age assessment procedures for unaccompanied minors are carried out in accordance with the CRC's provisions and the need for adequate protection and support for unaccompanied minors.
