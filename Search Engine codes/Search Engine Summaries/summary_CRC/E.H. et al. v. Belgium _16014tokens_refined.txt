Case Details:
- Case ID: CRC/C/89/D/55/2018
- Court/Tribunal: United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC)
- Document Date: 24 March 2022
- Key Parties Involved: E.B. (the author and victim) and the State party (Belgium)
- Case Name: E.B. v. Belgium
- Case Summary: E.B., a Serbian national, submitted a communication to the UNCRC on behalf of her four minor children, claiming that their detention and impending deportation to Serbia would violate their rights under the Convention on the Rights of the Child.

Procedural History:
The case involves the detention and planned deportation of a Roma woman, E.B., and her four minor children, who were born in Belgium. The author, E.B., is a national of Serbia and has been living in Belgium since 2010. The children have been living with their paternal grandmother, as their father is serving a prison sentence in Belgium. The case raises concerns about the rights of the child and the protection of the best interests of the child.

Legal Analysis and Reasoning:
The case is being examined under the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child, specifically articles 7(e) and (f), which deal with the protection of the best interests of the child and the right to seek relief for violations of the Convention. The main issue is whether the detention and planned deportation of the author and her children violates their rights under the Convention on the Rights of the Child.

Decisions and Rulings:
The Committee on the Rights of the Child found that the detention of the children constituted a violation of Article 37 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, as it was disproportionate and arbitrary. The State party failed to consider alternative measures that would have allowed the children to remain in Belgium, and did not adequately protect against refoulement.

Impact and Significance:
This decision has significant implications for the treatment of migrant children in detention centers. It emphasizes the importance of considering the best interests of the child in all decisions related to their detention and deportation. It also highlights the need for States to explore alternative measures that allow children to remain in the country, rather than resorting to detention.
