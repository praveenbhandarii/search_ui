- Case Summary: The authors, Z.Y. and J.Y., on behalf of their son A.Y., seek protection against deportation to Afghanistan, claiming a risk of persecution based on their alleged conversion from Islam.

The communication was submitted on 25 November 2016, and the Views were adopted on 31 May 2018. The Committee considered the communication under the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child.

Decisions and Rulings:
The State party suspended the execution of the deportation order against the authors and their son. The Committee found that some of the family's claims were inadmissible under the Optional Protocol due to failure to exhaust domestic remedies.

Impact and Significance:
This case raises important questions about the protection of children's rights in the context of deportation proceedings. It emphasizes the need for States to ensure that children are not returned to a country where they may face a risk of persecution or other human rights violations.
