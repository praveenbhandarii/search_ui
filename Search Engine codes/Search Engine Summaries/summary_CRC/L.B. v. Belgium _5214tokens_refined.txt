- Key Parties Involved: E.P. and L.B. (represented by counsel, Pierre Bayenet) vs. Belgium
- Case Name: E.P. and L.B. v. Belgium
- Case Summary: The authors of the communication, E.P. and L.B., claim that Belgium has violated L.B.'s rights under articles 2, 3 (1), 19, 28 (1) (c) and (e) and 29 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child. L.B., a Belgian national, was subjected to bullying at school due to his national origins and was denied the opportunity to repeat the fourth year of general education at the Centre d'Enseignement Secondaire Libre Notre-Dame-des-Champs.

Procedural History:
The communication was initially submitted on 25 March 2021, and the decision was adopted on 8 February 2022. The authors, E.P. and L.B., were represented by counsel, Pierre Bayenet. The case falls under the jurisdiction of the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child.

Legal Analysis and Reasoning:
The main issues in this case revolve around the violation of L.B.'s right to education, protection from discrimination, consideration of his best interests, and access to an effective remedy. The authors argue that Belgium failed to provide adequate support and resources to help L.B. succeed in his education, address the bullying he faced, and consider his best interests when making decisions about his education.

Decisions and Rulings:
The Committee on the Rights of the Child found the communication inadmissible under Article 7(f) of the Optional Protocol. The Committee concluded that the assessment of the facts and evidence by the class council and the authorities of the State party was reasonable and not a denial of justice.

Impact and Significance:
This case highlights the importance of ensuring that children have access to education and are not forced to repeat years of schooling unnecessarily. The decision reinforces the idea that children have the right to education and that authorities should consider all relevant factors when making decisions about a child's education.
