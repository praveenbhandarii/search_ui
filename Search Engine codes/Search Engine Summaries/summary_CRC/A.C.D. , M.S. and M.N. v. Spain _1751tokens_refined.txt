  - State party: Spain
- Case Name: A.C.D. v. Spain, M.S. v. Spain, M.N. v. Spain
- Case Summary: The authors, nationals of the Gambia, claimed that Spain violated their rights under the Convention on the Rights of the Child by using medical tests to determine their age without consent and without the presence of an interpreter.

Procedural History:
The communications were submitted under the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child. The Committee has jurisdiction over the case as the State party has ratified the Optional Protocol and the communications concern alleged violations of the Convention.

Legal Analysis and Reasoning:
The main issue is whether the State party violated the rights of the minors under the Convention by using medical tests to determine their age without consent and without the presence of an interpreter. The Committee must consider whether the use of medical tests to determine the age of unaccompanied minors violates their rights under the Convention.

Decisions and Rulings:
The Committee granted interim measures staying the deportation of the authors pending consideration of their cases. However, the Committee ultimately discontinued its consideration of the communications due to the loss of contact with the authors.

Impact and Significance:
This case raises important questions about the treatment of unaccompanied minors and the use of medical tests to determine their age. The outcome could have implications for the treatment of unaccompanied minors in Spain and potentially in other countries that use similar methods for age determination.
