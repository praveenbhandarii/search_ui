Case Details:
- Case ID: CRC/C/86/D/113/2020
- Court/Tribunal: United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC)
- Document Date: 24 February 2021
- Key Parties Involved: B.B. (represented by Jos Luis Rodriguez Candela) vs. Spain
- Case Name: B.B. v. Spain
- Case Summary: B.B., a Moroccan national living in Melilla, Spain, submitted a communication to the UNCRC claiming a violation of her children's rights under articles 2, 3, 28, and 29 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child. The author's children, who were born in Melilla and have lived there all their lives, are of Moroccan nationality and are considered irregular residents in Melilla. The author claimed that her children were denied the right to education because they did not have a registered residence in Melilla.

Procedural History:
The communication was submitted on 18 February 2020. The Committee on the Rights of the Child granted interim measures to prevent irreparable harm consisting of the loss of instructional time over the current school year while the proceedings were ongoing. The national judicial and administrative authorities continued to refuse to enroll the author's children in school and argued that the Committee's request for interim measures was not binding. The author's children were eventually enrolled in school after the father obtained a permit to reside in the city.

Legal Analysis and Reasoning:
The main issue in this case is the right to education of children of Moroccan nationality born in Melilla. The Committee on the Rights of the Child considered the communication and granted interim measures to ensure the children's right to education. The Committee reiterated its request for interim measures twice, emphasizing the compulsory nature of interim measures under Article 6 of the Optional Protocol.

Decisions and Rulings:
The Committee on the Rights of the Child decided to discontinue its consideration of the communication, considering that the authors' children have now been enrolled in school, although this fact does not in itself amount to full reparation for the alleged violations of the Convention.

Impact and Significance:
This case highlights the importance of ensuring the right to education for all children, regardless of their nationality or immigration status. It also emphasizes the role of the Committee on the Rights of the Child in protecting the rights of children and ensuring that States parties fulfill their obligations under the Convention. The decision may have implications for similar cases involving access to education for undocumented children or those with irregular administrative status.
