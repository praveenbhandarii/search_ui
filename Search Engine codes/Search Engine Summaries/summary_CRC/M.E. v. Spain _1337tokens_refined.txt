- Court/Tribunal: United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC)
- Document Date: 10 March 2022
- Key Parties Involved:
  - Party A: M. E. (the author and victim, represented by counsel, Marta Snchez Brias Otte)
  - Party B: Spain
- Case Name: M. E. v. Spain
- Case Summary: M. E., a Moroccan national, claimed that Spain had violated his rights under the Convention on the Rights of the Child by detaining him in a detention center for foreign nationals instead of placing him under the protection of the authorities as a minor.

Procedural History:
The communication was submitted under the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on a communications procedure on 12 March 2019. The case was brought before the UNCRC, which had jurisdiction and competence to address alleged violations of the Convention on the Rights of the Child.

Legal Analysis and Reasoning:
The UNCRC considered the communication and found that the author's rights had been violated. The Committee expressed concern about the age determination procedure followed by the State party and emphasized the importance of ensuring that children are treated in accordance with their rights under the CRC.

Decisions and Rulings:
The Committee decided to discontinue consideration of the case, citing rule 26 of its rules of procedure relating to the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on a communications procedure. The recognition of the complainant as a minor and their placement under the protection of the authorities rendered the communication moot, but did not in itself constitute full reparation for the alleged violations.

Impact and Significance:
This decision highlights the importance of protecting the rights of unaccompanied minors and ensuring that they are treated in accordance with their rights under the CRC. It also underscores the need for States parties to have appropriate procedures in place for determining the age of individuals who claim to be minors and to ensure that children are not detained in facilities unsuitable for their needs.
