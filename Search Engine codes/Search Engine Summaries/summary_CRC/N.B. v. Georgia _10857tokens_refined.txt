Case Name: N.B. v. Georgia
Case Summary: N.B., a national of Georgia born on 21 July 2013, alleges that the State party has violated his rights under articles 2, 12 and 19 of the Convention. The author claims that he was subjected to corporal punishment at his public kindergarten by a teacher on 24 January 2017.

Procedural History:
The Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on a communications procedure entered into force for the State party on 19 December 2016. The author's mother informed media outlets of the incident, leading to a criminal investigation and subsequent complaints to the Personal Data Protection Inspector. The author's lawyer also requested legal action from the police and prosecutor, which was denied. The author then filed a complaint with the Committee on the Rights of the Child.

Legal Analysis and Reasoning:
The case raises legal issues related to the rights of the child under the Convention, including protection from physical or mental violence, discrimination, and access to personal information. The State party's failure to criminalize corporal punishment and its inadequate response to the incident raise questions about the effectiveness of the legal framework in protecting children from violence.

Decisions and Rulings:
The Committee found that the State party failed to effectively investigate the alleged corporal punishment, violating its obligations under Article 19 of the Convention. The State party's responsibility for the child's injuries was also established.

Impact and Significance:
This case highlights the importance of protecting children from violence and the need for States to adopt appropriate legislative measures to prevent and address such incidents. It also emphasizes the significance of ensuring accountability and providing effective measures of protection to victims of violence.
