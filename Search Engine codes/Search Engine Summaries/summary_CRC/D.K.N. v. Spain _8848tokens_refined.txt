Case Details:
- Case ID: CRC/C/80/D/15/2017
- Court/Tribunal: United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC)
- Document Date: 2019
- Key Parties Involved: D.K.N. (the author and victim) vs. Spain (the state party)
- Case Name: D.K.N. v. Spain
- Case Summary: D.K.N., a citizen of Ghana, submitted a communication to the UNCRC claiming that Spain had violated his rights under Article 12 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child by not respecting his right to be heard during an age assessment procedure.

Procedural History:
The communication was submitted on 13 March 2017, and the UNCRC adopted its views on 1 February 2019. The case involved a procedural issue regarding the age assessment procedure in respect of an alleged unaccompanied child.

Legal Analysis and Reasoning:
The main issue in this case was whether Spain violated the author's rights under Article 12 of the CRC by not respecting his right to be heard during the age assessment procedure. The author argued that he was not notified of the decision to close his child protection case and that the age assessment procedure was flawed. The State party contended that the author failed to exhaust domestic remedies and did not provide sufficient evidence to challenge the age assessment.

Decisions and Rulings:
The Committee found that the communication was admissible and that the author's right to be heard was violated during the age assessment procedure. However, the Committee also found that the author did not sufficiently substantiate his claim, leading to the claim being declared inadmissible under the Optional Protocol.

Impact and Significance:
This case raises important questions about the rights of unaccompanied minors in the context of age assessment procedures. It highlights the need for age assessment procedures to be conducted fairly and accurately, and for minors to be provided with the necessary information and support to exercise their rights.
