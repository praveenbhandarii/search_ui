- Document Date: 2022
- Key Parties Involved:
  - M.S. (the author and victim, represented by counsel, Francisco Morenilla Belizn)
  - Spain (the state party)
- Case Name: M.S. v. Spain
- Case Summary: M.S., a national of Guinea, alleged that Spain violated his rights under articles 3 and 8 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child by using an age assessment procedure that did not take into account his best interests and right to be heard, and by failing to provide him with a guardian or legal representative.

Procedural History:
The communication was submitted under the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on a communications procedure on 5 August 2020.

Legal Analysis and Reasoning:
The main issue in this case was the irregular age assessment procedure followed by the Spanish authorities, which led to the author being treated as an adult despite being a minor. The author claimed that this had violated his rights under articles 3 and 8 of the CRC, including his right to be heard, right to a guardian, and right to special protection and assistance from the State.

Decisions and Rulings:
The CRC Committee analyzed the communication and found that the author had been recognized as a minor by the Spanish authorities, rendering the communication devoid of purpose. The Committee decided to discontinue its consideration of the communication, citing rule 26 of its rules of procedure under the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on a communications procedure.

Impact and Significance:
This decision highlights the importance of ensuring that unaccompanied minors are treated in accordance with their rights under international law. It emphasizes the need for States to have in place adequate procedures for assessing the age of unaccompanied minors and ensuring their protection and well-being.
