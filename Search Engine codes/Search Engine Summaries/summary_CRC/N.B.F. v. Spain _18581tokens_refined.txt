- Case Summary: N.B.F., a citizen of CÃ´te d'Ivoire, claimed to be a victim of violations of articles 3, 8, 12, 18 (2), 20, 27 and 29 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child. The author was intercepted by the Spanish National Police while attempting to enter Spain illegally and was subsequently detained. The author's age was determined to be over 19 years through osteometric tests, and they were declared to be of legal age. The author was placed in a holding center for foreign nationals pending deportation. They maintain that they have exhausted all available domestic remedies and that their rights under the Convention have been violated.

Procedural History:
The Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on a communications procedure entered into force for Spain on 14 April 2014. The Committee considered the communication under article 6 of the Optional Protocol, which provides for the consideration of communications from individuals claiming to be victims of violations of the Convention.

Legal Analysis and Reasoning:
The author's communication was submitted under the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on a communications procedure. The Committee considered the communication under articles 3 and 12 of the Convention, which relate to the best interests of the child and the right to protection from economic exploitation. The author argued that the age assessment process used in Spain was flawed and violated the Convention on the Rights of the Child.

Decisions and Rulings:
The Committee found that the State party had violated the author's rights under articles 3 and 12 of the Convention by failing to appoint a representative to assist the young person with the age assessment procedure. The Committee held that the State party's age-determination process was not reliable and lacked precision, which raised concerns about the accuracy and reliability of the results.

Impact and Significance:
This decision has important implications for the protection of children's rights in the context of age assessment procedures. It highlights the importance of ensuring that children are afforded appropriate representation during such procedures to ensure that their best interests are protected. A decision in favor of the complainant could set a precedent for future cases involving the rights of children in similar situations.
