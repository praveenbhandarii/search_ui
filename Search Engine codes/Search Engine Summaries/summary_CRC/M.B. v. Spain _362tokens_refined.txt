Procedural History:
The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) Committee received a communication (No. 39/2017) from an alleged unaccompanied migrant child, M.B., who was detained in a center for adult migrants and required to undergo a medical examination to determine his age.

The issue at hand is whether the CRC Committee should continue to consider the communication from an alleged unaccompanied migrant child who has been detained in a center for adult migrants and required to undergo a medical examination to determine his age. The Committee decided to discontinue the consideration of the communication due to the request for discontinuation filed by the author's representative.

Decisions and Rulings:
Meeting on May 31, 2018, the Committee on the Rights of the Child decided to discontinue the consideration of communication No. 39/2017, in accordance with rule 26 of its rules of procedure under the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on a communications procedure.

Impact and Significance:
