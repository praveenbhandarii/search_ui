Case Details:
- Case ID: CRC/C/85/D/26/2017
- Court/Tribunal: United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC)
- Document Date: 2 November 2020
- Key Parties Involved:
  - Party A: M.B.S. (the author and victim)
  - Party B: Spain (the state party)
- Case Name: M.B.S. v. Spain
- Case Summary: M.B.S., a national of Guinea, claimed to be a victim of violations of several articles of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, including articles 2, 3, 8, 12, 18(2), 20(1), 27, and 29. He was intercepted by local police while traveling in a small boat and was transferred to a hospital where an X-ray of his wrist was taken, showing that he was 19 years old according to the Greulich and Pyle atlas. The author was then transferred to a holding center for foreign nationals in Madrid, where he was subjected to further medical tests, including dental and wrist X-rays, which reportedly showed that he was an adult.

Procedural History:
The case involved a communication submitted to the Committee on the Rights of the Child by M.B.S., a minor, who alleged violations of his rights under the Convention on the Rights of the Child by the Spanish authorities. The communication was submitted on 19 July 2017, and the Committee adopted its views on the case on 2 November 2020.

Legal Analysis and Reasoning:
The main issues in the case included the failure of the Spanish authorities to presume M.B.S. to be a minor, the lack of appointment of a guardian to protect his interests, and the failure to provide him with adequate protection. The Committee found that the State party's actions were in violation of articles 3, 18(2), and 20(1) of the Convention. The Committee also emphasized the importance of using a holistic approach to age assessment and ensuring that the process is conducted in a scientific, safe, child- and gender-sensitive manner.

Decisions and Rulings:
The Committee found that Spain had violated M.B.S.'s rights under the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Optional Protocol. The Committee recommended that Spain provide the author with effective reparation, take measures to prevent similar violations in the future, and ensure that all procedures for determining the age of young persons claiming to be minors are in line with the CRC.

Impact and Significance:
This decision is significant as it highlights the importance of protecting the rights of unaccompanied minors and ensuring that their best interests are taken into account in all proceedings related to their age determination. It also underscores the obligation of States parties to respect the identity of children and to ensure that their personal information is not altered without proper evidence or consent.
