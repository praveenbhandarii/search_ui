- Document Date: 7 March 2023
- Key Parties Involved: L. H. C. (represented by Beatriz Aragón Martín, Blanca Gómez Bengoechea and Luis Ignacio Mateo Ramírez) vs. Spain
- Case Name: L. H. C. v. Spain
- Case Summary: L. H. C., a 3-year-old girl living in an informal settlement in Madrid, Spain, suffering from a rare lung disease, submitted a communication to the UNCRC claiming violation of her rights under articles 3(1), 4, 6, 12, 24, 27 and 28 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child due to the lack of adequate housing and healthcare services.

Procedural History:
The communication was submitted under the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child. The Committee on the Rights of the Child has jurisdiction over the case.

Legal Analysis and Reasoning:
The main issue in this case is the State party's failure to provide adequate housing for a child with a lung disease, which puts her health at risk. The author argues that the State party's failure to provide alternative housing violates her rights to health, adequate standard of living, and protection from discrimination.

Decisions and Rulings:
The Committee, acting through its Working Group on Communications, registered the individual communication and granted interim measures by requesting the State party to provide the author with the necessary medical and social services, including adequate accommodation to meet her health needs, without separating her from her family.

Impact and Significance:
This case highlights the importance of ensuring access to basic necessities, such as electricity, for vulnerable populations, particularly children with disabilities. It also underscores the State's obligation to protect the rights of children and ensure their well-being, particularly those living in informal settlements.
