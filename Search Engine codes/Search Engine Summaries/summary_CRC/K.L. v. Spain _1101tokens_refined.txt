Case Details:
- Case ID: CRC/C/85/D/29/2017
- Court/Tribunal: United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC)
- Document Date: 2020
- Key Parties Involved: K.L. (represented by counsel, Albert Pars Casanova) vs. Spain
- Case Name: K.L. v. Spain
- Case Summary: K.L., an unaccompanied minor, was intercepted while trying to reach Spain in a small boat. He claimed to be a minor and underwent medical age determination tests, which showed that he was probably at least 18 years old. K.L. was returned to Algeria twice, and he alleges that his rights under articles 3, 8, 18(2), 20(1), 27, and 29 of the Convention were violated by the Spanish authorities.

Procedural History:
The communication No. 29/2017 was submitted to the Committee under the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on a communications procedure. The date of communication was 5 July 2019.

Legal Analysis and Reasoning:
The main issues in this case are whether the Spanish authorities took into account the best interests of the child in their decisions regarding the author's detention and deportation, and whether they failed to protect the author as a child deprived of his family environment. The CRC Committee found that the author's representative had lost contact with the author since his deportation, and his whereabouts were unknown. Therefore, the Committee decided to discontinue consideration of the communication.

Decisions and Rulings:
The Committee on the Rights of the Child considered the communication without merit and decided to discontinue consideration of communication No. 29/2017, in accordance with rule 26 of its rules of procedure under the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on a communications procedure.

Impact and Significance:
This case highlights the importance of protecting the rights of unaccompanied minors and ensuring that their best interests are taken into account in all decisions related to their detention and deportation. It also underscores the need for States to provide adequate protection and care for children deprived of their family environment.
