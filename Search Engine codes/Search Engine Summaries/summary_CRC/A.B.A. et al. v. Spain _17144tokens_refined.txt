- Case Summary: The authors of the communications, who are Moroccan children born and raised in Spain, claim that the State party has violated their rights under articles 2, 3, and 28 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child.

Procedural History:
- The alleged victims, represented by counsel, submitted communications to the UNCRC on specific dates in 2020.
- The UNCRC has jurisdiction over the communications pursuant to the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child.
- The main issue in these communications is the right to education of Moroccan children born and raised in Spain, specifically in Melilla.

Legal Analysis and Reasoning:
- The authors have alleged violations of the right to education, discrimination, and failure to exhaust domestic remedies.
- The main issue is the denial of the right to education to children of Moroccan origin born and residing in Spain, specifically in Melilla.
- The authors argue that the State party has failed to provide them with access to the public education system in Melilla, despite their entitlement to it under Spanish law.

Decisions and Rulings:
- The CRC Committee found that the State party's actions constitute discrimination based on nationality and immigration status.
- The Committee emphasized that the right to education is a fundamental right that cannot be denied on the basis of a person's immigration status.

Impact and Significance:
- These communications highlight the importance of ensuring access to education for all children, regardless of their nationality or immigration status.
- If the CRC Committee finds that the State party has violated the authors' rights, it could have significant implications for the education system in Spain and potentially lead to changes in the country's laws and policies regarding access to education for foreign nationals.
