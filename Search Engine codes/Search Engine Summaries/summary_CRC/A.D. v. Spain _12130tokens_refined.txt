- Key Parties Involved:
  - A.D. (the author and victim, represented by counsel, Albert Pars Casanova)
  - Spain (the state party)
- Case Name: A.D. v. Spain
- Case Summary: A.D., a citizen of the Republic of Guinea, claimed to have been born on 2 February 2003 and alleged that Spain had violated his rights under the Convention on the Rights of the Child by assessing his age using a radiological test that was not reliable and by failing to consider his best interests during the age assessment process.

Procedural History:
The case involves a complaint submitted to the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child by an unaccompanied minor, A.D., who claimed to have been born on February 2, 2003, and was intercepted by the Spanish National Police while attempting to enter Spain illegally on March 1, 2017. The author alleges that the age assessment conducted by the Spanish authorities violated Article 3 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, as it did not consider the best interests of the child.

Legal Analysis and Reasoning:
The Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on a communications procedure entered into force for Spain on April 14, 2014. Under Article 6 of the Optional Protocol, the Working Group on Communications, acting on behalf of the Committee, requested that Spain refrain from returning the author to his country of origin and transfer him to a child protection center while his case was pending consideration by the Committee. The author argues that the age assessment conducted by the Spanish authorities violated Article 3 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, as it did not consider the best interests of the child.

Decisions and Rulings:
The Committee found that Spain violated the rights of the author by failing to consider his best interests during the age assessment process and by using unreliable methods to determine his age. The Committee requested Spain to refrain from returning the author to his country of origin and transfer him to a child protection center while his case was pending consideration.

Impact and Significance:
This case raises important questions about the treatment of unaccompanied minors and the obligations of states parties under the Convention on the Rights of the Child. It highlights the need for states parties to ensure that age assessments are conducted in a manner that considers the best interests of the child and uses reliable methods. The case also underscores the importance of providing appropriate protection and care for unaccompanied minors, including access to child protection centers.
