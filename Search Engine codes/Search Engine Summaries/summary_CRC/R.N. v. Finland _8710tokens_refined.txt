- Case Summary: R.N. submitted a communication to the UNCRC on behalf of her son L.H.A.N., alleging that Finland had violated their rights under the Convention on the Rights of the Child by failing to protect them from the father's abuse and neglect and by granting custody to the father despite his history of violence.

Procedural History:
The communication was submitted on 15 August 2019, and the decision was adopted on 28 September 2020. The case involves a dispute between a mother and a father over the custody of their child, L.H.A.N. The mother has alleged that the father has been physically and emotionally abusive to the child and that the child's best interests are not being protected by the current custody arrangement.

Legal Analysis and Reasoning:
The author alleges violations of various provisions of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, including articles 2, 3, 4, 18, 24, 25, 35, and 39. The main issues raised in this communication are the right to protection from violence and abuse, the failure of the State party to protect the child from this abuse, and the inadequacy of the current custody arrangement in representing the child's best interests.

Decisions and Rulings:
The Committee found that the communication was admissible and that the State party had failed to protect the child from the father's abuse and manipulation. The Committee also concluded that the State party's failures had caused significant harm to the child, both physically and emotionally, and had violated the child's rights under the CRC.

Impact and Significance:
This case raises important questions about the obligations of States parties under the Convention on the Rights of the Child to protect children from violence and abuse, and to ensure that their best interests are taken into account in all decisions affecting them. It also highlights the importance of ensuring that children's voices are heard and respected in such decisions, and that their wishes are not manipulated or ignored.
