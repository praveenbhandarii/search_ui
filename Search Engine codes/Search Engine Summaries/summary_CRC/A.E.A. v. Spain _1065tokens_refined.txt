Summary:

Case Details:
- Case ID: CRC/C/87/D/88/2019
- Court/Tribunal: United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC)
- Document Date: 2021
- Key Parties Involved: A.E.A. (represented by counsel, Albert Pars Casanova) vs. Spain
- Case Name: A.E.A. v. Spain
- Case Summary: A.E.A., a Moroccan national, claimed that Spain violated his rights under articles 3, 8, 18 (2), 20 (1), 27, and 29 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child. He was intercepted while trying to reach the coast of Algeciras in a small boat and was subsequently placed in a holding center for adult foreign nationals. The Committee on the Rights of the Child considered the communication and requested interim measures consisting of a stay in the execution of the order for the author's deportation, pending consideration of his case by the Committee, and his transfer to a child protection center.

Procedural History:
The communication was submitted under the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on a communications procedure, which entered into force for Spain on April 14, 2014. The Committee on the Rights of the Child is responsible for examining the communication and determining whether the State party has violated the author's rights under the CRC.

Legal Analysis and Reasoning:
The main issue in this case is whether the Spanish authorities violated A.E.A.'s rights under the CRC by not taking into account the best interests of the child in their decisions and by not protecting him as a child. The author argues that he was not protected as a child and that his rights were violated when he was placed in a holding center for adult foreign nationals.

Decisions and Rulings:
The Committee on the Rights of the Child requested interim measures consisting of a stay in the execution of the order for the author's deportation, pending consideration of his case by the Committee, and his transfer to a child protection center.

Impact and Significance:
This case highlights the importance of protecting the rights of unaccompanied minors and ensuring that their best interests are taken into account in all decisions affecting them. It also underscores the need for States to comply with their obligations under the CRC, including the provision of special protection and assistance to children in need.
