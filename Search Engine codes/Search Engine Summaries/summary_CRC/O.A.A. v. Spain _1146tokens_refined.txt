- Court/Tribunal: United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC)

- Key Parties Involved: O.A.A. (represented by counsel, Albert Casanova Pars) vs. Spain
- Case Name: O.A.A. v. Spain
- Case Summary: O.A.A., a national of CÃ´te d'Ivoire, alleged that Spain violated his rights under articles 3, 8, 20, 27, and 29 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child. O.A.A. was arrested by Spain's border police while traveling on a boat and was declared to be of age based on an X-ray of his left wrist. He was issued a deportation order and was held in an immigration detention center. O.A.A. submitted a copy of his passport to the authorities, requesting a review of the age assessment decree, but did not receive a response.

Procedural History:
The Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on a communications procedure entered into force for Spain on April 14, 2014. The Working Group on Communications, acting on behalf of the Committee, requested Spain to adopt interim measures and stay the enforcement of the deportation order pending the Committee's consideration of the case. Spain submitted its observations on the admissibility and merits of the communication and requested that consideration of the communication be discontinued. The Committee noted that O.A.A.'s counsel had not submitted comments on the admissibility and merits of the communication or on Spain's request for discontinuance and decided to discontinue its consideration of the communication.

Legal Analysis and Reasoning:
The communication raised issues related to the rights of unaccompanied minors, including the right to identity, right to be heard, right to a guardian, right to development, and right to special protection and assistance from the state. The CRC Committee's decision highlighted the importance of considering the best interests of the child in all actions concerning children, as required by article 20 of the CRC.

Decisions and Rulings:
The CRC Committee discontinued consideration of the communication due to O.A.A.'s lack of interest in submitting comments on the admissibility and merits of the communication or on Spain's request for discontinuance.

Impact and Significance:
This case is relevant to the ongoing discussion about the treatment of unaccompanied minors in the context of migration and asylum policies. It sets an important precedent for the protection of unaccompanied minors and serves as a reminder to states of their obligations under the CRC.
