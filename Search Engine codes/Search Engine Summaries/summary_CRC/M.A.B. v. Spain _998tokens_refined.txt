Case Details:
- Case ID: CRC/C/89/D/41/2018
- Court/Tribunal: United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC)
- Document Date: 2022
- Key Parties Involved: M.A.B. (represented by counsel, Francisco Solans Puyuelo) vs. Spain
- Case Name: M.A.B. v. Spain
- Case Summary: M.A.B., a national of Guinea aged 14 at the time of submission of the communication, claims that Spain has violated his rights under article 3, read in conjunction with articles 18 (2) and 20 (1), and articles 8, 20, 27 and 29 of the Convention.

Procedural History:
The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) Committee received a communication (No. 41/2018) from M.A.B., a national of Guinea, claiming that Spain had violated his rights under the Convention. M.A.B. was intercepted by Spanish border police while attempting to enter the country and was subsequently detained. The public prosecution service issued a decree confirming his age, and an expulsion order was issued. The CRC Committee's Working Group on Communications requested Spain to adopt interim measures, including staying the enforcement of the deportation order and transferring M.A.B. to a child protection center. Spain submitted its observations on the admissibility and merits of the communication, but M.A.B. did not respond. The Committee discontinued its consideration of the communication due to M.A.B.'s lack of interest.

Legal Analysis and Reasoning:
The communication raises several issues related to the rights of the child, including the right to be heard, the right to a guardian, the right to development, and the right to special protection and assistance from the State. The main issue in this case is whether Spain violated M.A.B.'s rights under the Convention by failing to properly assess his age and ignoring his claim to be a minor. The author argues that the medical assessment used to determine his age was unreliable and that the public prosecution service's decision was based solely on this assessment.

Decisions and Rulings:
The Committee discontinued its consideration of the communication due to M.A.B.'s lack of interest.

Impact and Significance:
This case highlights the importance of proper age assessment procedures for unaccompanied minors and the need for States to consider the best interests of the child in all decisions affecting them. The outcome of this case could have implications for the treatment of unaccompanied minors in Spain and potentially influence the development of age assessment procedures in other countries.
