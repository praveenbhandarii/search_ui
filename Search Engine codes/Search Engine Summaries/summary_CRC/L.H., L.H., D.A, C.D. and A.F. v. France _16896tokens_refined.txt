- Document Date: 2 November 2020
- Key Parties Involved:
  - Alleged victims: L.H., L.H., D.A, C.D. and A.F. (represented by counsel, Mr. Pradel)
  - State party: France
- Case Name: L.H. and others v. France
- Case Summary: The authors of the communications, who are grandparents of children whose parents are linked to terrorism activities, allege that the Government of France did not take the necessary measures to repatriate the children to France, which they claim constitutes a violation of articles 2, 3, 6, 20, 24 and 37 of the Convention.

Procedural History:
The communications were submitted on 13 March and 25 November 2019. The Working Group on Communications, acting on behalf of the Committee, denied the authors' request for interim measures consisting in the repatriation of the children to France. However, the Committee requested the State party to take diplomatic measures to ensure the protection of the right to life and integrity of the children, including access to any medical care they may need.

Legal Analysis and Reasoning:
The main legal issues addressed in this case are the right to life, integrity, and health of the children, the right to protection from unlawful detention, and the extraterritorial jurisdiction of the Committee on the Rights of the Child. The authors argue that the French government's failure to repatriate the children violates their rights under the Convention. They also argue that the children are being held in camps under the control of Kurdish forces in Syrian Kurdistan, which amounts to unlawful detention. Furthermore, the authors contend that the Committee has extraterritorial jurisdiction over the matter pursuant to the Optional Protocol.

Decisions and Rulings:
The Working Group on Communications denied the authors' request for interim measures, but the Committee requested the State party to take diplomatic measures to ensure the protection of the right to life and integrity of the children, including access to any medical care they may need.

Impact and Significance:
This case has significant implications for the protection of children's rights in the context of armed conflicts and terrorism. It highlights the importance of states taking appropriate measures to protect children from the effects of armed conflict and ensuring their access to basic rights such as healthcare and education. The case also underscores the extraterritorial jurisdiction of the Committee on the Rights of the Child and its role in protecting children's rights worldwide.
