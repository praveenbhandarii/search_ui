- Case Name: E.P. and F.P. v. Denmark
- Case Summary: The case involves the deportation of two Albanian children, A.P. and K.P., from Denmark to Albania, where they claim a risk of persecution based on a blood feud. The parents, E.P. and F.P., submitted a communication to the UNCRC, alleging that their children's rights under the Convention on the Rights of the Child would be violated if they were deported.

Procedural History:
The communication was submitted on 10 September 2017, and the decision was adopted on 25 September 2019. The authors, E.P. and F.P., represented by counsel, D. Norrung, submitted the communication to the UNCRC.

Legal Analysis and Reasoning:
The case was analyzed under articles 2, 3, 6, and 28 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, as well as the Optional Protocol to the Convention. The main issue was whether the deportation of the children would violate their rights under the Convention. The authors argued that their children's best interests were not taken into account, and that their deportation would put them at risk of persecution based on a blood feud in Albania.

Decisions and Rulings:
The Committee found that the children's rights would be violated if they were deported, as their best interests were not considered and they faced a risk of persecution based on a blood feud in Albania.

Impact and Significance:
This case has implications for the protection of children's rights in deportation proceedings and highlights the importance of considering the best interests of the child. It also underscores the need for States to ensure that they are not violating children's rights by deporting them to countries where they may face a risk of persecution or harm.
