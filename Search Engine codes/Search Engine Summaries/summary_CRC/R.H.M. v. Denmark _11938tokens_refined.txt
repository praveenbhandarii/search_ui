Case Name: R.H.M. v. Denmark

Procedural History:
The author, R.H.M., a national of Somalia, and her daughter, Y.A.M., were subject to a deportation order to Somalia. The author claimed that her daughter's deportation would violate her rights under articles 3 and 19 of the Convention. The case was initially submitted to the European Court of Human Rights and later brought before the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child.

Legal Analysis and Reasoning:
The case addressed the potential risk of female genital mutilation (FGM) faced by the author's daughter if deported to Somalia, and the State party's failure to adequately consider the best interests of the child. The Committee considered the communication under the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child, which provides for the consideration of communications from individuals claiming to be victims of a violation of the rights set forth in the CRC.

Decisions and Rulings:
The Committee found that the State party had failed to consider the best interests of the child and to take proper safeguards to ensure the child's well-being upon return. The State party's assessment of the mother's ability to resist social pressure was deemed insufficient, and the risk of FGM in Somalia was not adequately assessed.

Impact and Significance:
This case sets a precedent for the protection of children's rights in the context of migration and asylum policies. It emphasizes the importance of considering the best interests of the child in all decisions related to their return or deportation and highlights the need for States parties to take active steps to protect children from all forms of physical or mental violence, including FGM.
