Summary:

Case Details:
- Case ID: CRC/C/92/D/147/2021
- Court/Tribunal: United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC)
- Document Date: 2023
- Key Parties Involved: K.E.Y. (represented by counsel, Glenda Josefina Fermn Rodriguez) vs. Spain
- Case Name: K.E.Y. v. Spain
- Case Summary: K.E.Y., a Moroccan national living in Melilla, Spain, submitted a communication to the UNCRC claiming that her son, M.Z., was denied the right to education because of his nationality. The author claimed that the State party had violated her son's rights under articles 2, 3, 28, and 29 of the Convention.

Procedural History:
The communication was submitted under the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on a communications procedure. The Committee requested the State party to take interim measures in the form of the immediate enrollment of M.Z. in school while the case was under consideration. The State party reported that M.Z. had been admitted to school for the 2021/22 academic year, and the Committee decided to discontinue its consideration of the communication.

Legal Analysis and Reasoning:
The main issue in this case was the right to education of children of Moroccan nationality born in Melilla. The Committee recognized the importance of access to education for children and noted that the enrollment of M.Z. in school was a positive development. However, the Committee also acknowledged that the enrollment of M.Z. in school does not in itself amount to full reparation for the alleged violations of the Convention.

Decisions and Rulings:
The Committee decided to discontinue its consideration of communication No. 147/2021, in accordance with rule 26 of its rules of procedure under the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on a communications procedure, as M.Z. had been enrolled in school and the continued schooling of M.Z. rendered the communication devoid of purpose.

Impact and Significance:
This case highlights the importance of ensuring access to education for all children, regardless of their nationality or immigration status. It also underscores the role of the CRC Committee in protecting the rights of children and holding States accountable for their obligations under the Convention. The decision of the Committee to discontinue the communication due to the enrollment of M.Z. in school may have implications for similar cases where children are denied access to education based on their nationality or immigration status.
