- Key Parties Involved:
  - M.H. (the author and victim)

- Case Name: M.H. v. Finland
- Case Summary: M.H., a Finnish-Nigerian national, alleges that Finland has violated his rights under articles 2, 3, 16, 19, and 24 (3) of the Convention on the Rights of the Child by subjecting him to circumcision for non-medical reasons, without his consent, and without exhausting domestic remedies.

Procedural History:
The Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child entered into force for Finland on 12 February 2016. The case involves a dispute between M.H.'s Finnish mother and Catholic Nigerian father regarding the circumcision of M.H. The District Court of Helsinki convicted the father of assault, but the Supreme Court ultimately concluded that the circumcision was not in the child's best interests.

Legal Analysis and Reasoning:
The case was analyzed under various provisions of the Convention, including Articles 2, 3, 16, 19, and 24(3). The Committee found that Finland had violated M.H.'s rights by failing to protect him from all forms of violence or ill-treatment, including those based on gender, race, and ethnicity. The Committee also found that Finland had failed to ensure that M.H.'s best interests were a primary consideration in decision-making processes affecting him.

Decisions and Rulings:
The Supreme Court of Finland ultimately concluded that the circumcision was not in the child's best interests, as it was a non-medical interference in the child's physical integrity that was not justified by the father's cultural or religious reasons.

Impact and Significance:
This case has significant implications for the protection of children's rights, particularly in contexts where religious or cultural beliefs may conflict with children's rights. It highlights the importance of ensuring that children are protected from harmful practices and that their best interests are prioritized in decision-making processes.
