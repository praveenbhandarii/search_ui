- Document Date: 2021
- Key Parties Involved:
  - Chiara Sacchi, et al. (the authors and victims)
  - Brazil (the state party)
- Case Name: Sacchi et al. v. Brazil
- Case Summary: The authors, who are minors, allege that Brazil has violated their rights under the Convention on the Rights of the Child by failing to prevent and mitigate the consequences of climate change.

Procedural History:
The Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child entered into force for Brazil on December 29, 2017. The working group on communications requested Brazil to submit its observations on the admissibility of the communication separately from its observations on the merits. The authors argue that Brazil has failed to take the necessary preventive and precautionary measures to respect, protect, and fulfill their rights to life, health, and culture.

Legal Analysis and Reasoning:
The authors rely on articles 6, 24, and 30 of the Convention, which respectively guarantee the rights to life, health, and protection from economic exploitation, as well as the right to enjoy the highest attainable standard of living. They argue that Brazil has failed to prevent foreseeable domestic and extraterritorial human rights violations resulting from climate change, to cooperate internationally in the face of the global climate emergency, to apply the precautionary principle to protect life in the face of uncertainty, and to ensure intergenerational justice for children and posterity.

Decisions and Rulings:
The Committee must determine whether the State party's acts or omissions in relation to climate change have violated the rights of the authors as children. The Committee concluded that the authors had sufficiently justified their victim status and that the State party's acts or omissions regarding carbon emissions originating within its territory were reasonably foreseeable.

Impact and Significance:
This case has significant implications for the protection of the environment and the rights of children. It emphasizes the responsibility of States to take action to mitigate the effects of climate change and to protect children from foreseeable harm. The decision also underscores the importance of international cooperation in addressing the issue of climate change and its impact on human rights.
