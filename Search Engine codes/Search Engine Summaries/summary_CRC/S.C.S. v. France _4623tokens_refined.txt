- Court/Tribunal: United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC)
- Document Date: 26 March 2018
- Key Parties Involved:

  - France (State party)
- Case Name: S.C.S. et al. v. France
- Case Summary: The authors, members of the Roma community, were evicted from a Roma camp in France, denied emergency accommodation, and forced to live on the roadside. They claim this violated their rights under the Convention on the Rights of the Child.

Procedural History:
The communication was submitted to the UNCRC on 5 January 2017, invoking the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child. The State party challenged the admissibility of the communication, citing incompatibility ratione temporis.

Legal Analysis and Reasoning:
The eviction of the Roma family may have violated their rights under the Convention on the Rights of the Child, including the right to housing, health, education, and protection from discrimination. The State party's failure to provide alternative accommodation and the best interests of the child were also considered.

Decisions and Rulings:
The Committee must decide on the admissibility of the communication under the Optional Protocol. The State party did not provide evidence to refute the author's claims, and the best interests of the child were invoked in the submissions to domestic courts.

Impact and Significance:
This case raises important questions about the rights of Romani children and their families, the treatment of Romani communities in France, and the implications for forced evictions and discrimination.
