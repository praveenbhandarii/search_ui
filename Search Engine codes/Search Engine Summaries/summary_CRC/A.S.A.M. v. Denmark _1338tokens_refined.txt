- Case Name: A.S.A.M. and A.S. v. Denmark
- Case Summary: A.S.A.M. and his daughter A.S., a national of Somalia, submitted a communication to the UNCRC claiming that A.S.'s deportation to Somalia would violate her rights under the Convention on the Rights of the Child.

Procedural History:
- The Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on a communications procedure entered into force for the State party on 7 January 2016.
- A.S. entered Denmark in 2013 and was granted a residence permit on 4 July 2013.
- The Danish Immigration Service decided not to extend the permits of A.S.A.M. and A.S. on 11 July 2017.
- The author filed an appeal to the Refugee Appeals Board on 14 July 2017, which was rejected on 7 February 2019.
- The Committee requested interim measures to suspend the deportation of A.S.A.M. and A.S. on 16 May 2019.
- The State party submitted its observations on the admissibility of the communication on 5 July 2019.
- The Committee decided to lift the interim measures on 15 August 2019.
- The author informed the Committee that his daughter had been granted asylum on 27 January 2022.
- The Committee discontinued the consideration of the communication on 12 September 2022.

Legal Analysis and Reasoning:
- The main issue was whether A.S.'s deportation to Somalia would violate her rights under the Convention on the Rights of the Child.
- The State party argued that the communication was inadmissible due to the failure to exhaust domestic remedies within the required timeframe.

Decisions and Rulings:
- The Committee found the communication inadmissible under the Optional Protocol, but later lifted the interim measures and discontinued the consideration of the communication after the author's daughter was granted asylum.

Impact and Significance:
- The decision highlights the importance of protecting children from harmful practices such as female genital mutilation and ensuring that children's rights are protected in the context of deportation and immigration proceedings.
- The decision may set a precedent for similar cases involving the deportation of children who may face a risk of harm in their home country.
