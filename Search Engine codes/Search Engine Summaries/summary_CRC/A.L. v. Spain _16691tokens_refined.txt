- Court/Tribunal: United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC)
- Document Date: 2019
- Key Parties Involved:
  - A.L. (the author and victim)
  - Spain (the state party)
- Case Name: A.L. v. Spain
- Case Summary: A.L., a citizen of Algeria, claimed to be a minor and sought protection from deportation from Spain. Spain disputed A.L.'s age and subjected him to an age determination process, leading to his placement in a holding center for foreign nationals reserved for adults.

Procedural History:
The case involved a communication submitted to the UNCRC by A.L., who alleged violations of articles 3, 8, 12, 18 (2), 20, 27, and 29 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child. The Committee considered the admissibility of the communication and the State party's compliance with interim measures requested under the Optional Protocol.

Legal Analysis and Reasoning:
The Committee found that Spain violated A.L.'s rights under the Convention by failing to properly determine his age and by altering his identity. The use of an X-ray test as the sole method for age determination was deemed unreliable, and Spain's failure to appoint a qualified legal representative for A.L. during the process was a violation of his rights.

Decisions and Rulings:
The Committee ruled in favor of A.L., finding Spain in violation of articles 3, 8, and 12 of the Convention, as well as article 6 of the Optional Protocol. The Committee emphasized the importance of protecting the rights of unaccompanied children and ensuring that their best interests are considered in all decisions affecting them.

Impact and Significance:
This decision sets a precedent for the protection of unaccompanied children's rights and underscores the obligation of State parties to comply with interim measures requested under the Optional Protocol. It highlights the importance of proper age determination processes and the need for States to ensure that children are represented by qualified legal representatives during such processes.
