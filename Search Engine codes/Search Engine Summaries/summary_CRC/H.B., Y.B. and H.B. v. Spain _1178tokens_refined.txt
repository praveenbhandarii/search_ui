- Document Date: 21 May 2021
- Key Parties Involved: H.B., Y.B. and H.B. (represented by counsel, Ángela Álvarez Muñoz) vs. Spain
- Case Name: H.B., Y.B. and H.B. v. Spain
- Case Summary: The authors of the communication, who are Algerian nationals, claimed that the State party (Spain) had violated their rights under articles 2, 3, 8, 12, 18 (2), 20 (1), 27 and 29 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child. They alleged that the Spanish authorities did not take into account the best interests of the child in their decisions, and that they were not protected as children deprived of their family environment.

Procedural History:
The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) Committee received three communications (No. 57/2018, No. 58/2018, and No. 59/2018) from H.B., Y.B., and H.B. (represented by counsel, Ángela Álvarez Muñoz) against Spain. The communications alleged violations of the authors' rights under articles 2, 3, 8, 12, 18(2), 20(1), 27, and 29 of the CRC.

Legal Analysis and Reasoning:
The CRC Committee considered the communications under the Optional Protocol to the CRC on a communications procedure. The Committee noted that the authors were recognized as minors by the State party's authorities, and therefore, the communications were rendered moot. The issues raised in the communications include the failure of the Spanish authorities to take into account the best interests of the child in their decisions and the lack of protection afforded to the authors as children deprived of their family environment.

Decisions and Rulings:
The Committee decided to discontinue its consideration of the communications in accordance with rule 26 of its rules of procedure under the Optional Protocol.

Impact and Significance:
The case emphasizes the need for States to ensure that the best interests of the child are taken into account in all decisions affecting children, as required by article 21 of the CRC. The decision to discontinue consideration of the communications due to the recognition of the authors' minority status underscores the significance of accurate age assessments in the protection of children's rights.
