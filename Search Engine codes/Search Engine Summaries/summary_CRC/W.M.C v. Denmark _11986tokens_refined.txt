- Document Date: 2020
- Key Parties Involved: W.M.C. (the author and victim) vs. State party: X.C., L.G. and W.G.
- Case Name: W.M.C. v. Denmark
- Case Summary: W.M.C., a Chinese national, fled to Denmark after a forced abortion and gave birth to two children. She applied for asylum, but her application was denied. She claimed that her deportation would violate her children's rights under the Convention on the Rights of the Child.

Procedural History:
The author, W.M.C., submitted a communication under the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child, alleging violations of her and her children's rights under the Convention. The State party, Denmark, disputed the claims and argued that the Refugee Appeals Board's decision was lawful and in accordance with the Convention.

Legal Analysis and Reasoning:
The main legal issues addressed in the case were the potential violations of the children's rights under the Convention on the Rights of the Child, specifically articles 2, 3, 6, 7, and 8. The author argued that the deportation of her children to China would put them at risk of various violations, including lack of access to healthcare, education, and social services. The State party contended that the Refugee Appeals Board's decision was lawful and in accordance with the Convention.

Decisions and Rulings:
The Committee on the Rights of the Child found some of the author's claims admissible, while others were declared inadmissible. The Committee concluded that the State party failed to consider the best interests of the child and the potential risks the children would face if deported to China. The Committee also found that the denial of a hukou to the children would violate their rights under the Convention.

Impact and Significance:
This case sets a precedent for the protection of children's rights in the context of deportation and asylum proceedings. It emphasizes the importance of considering the best interests of the child and ensuring that children have access to basic services such as healthcare, education, and social services, regardless of their immigration status.
