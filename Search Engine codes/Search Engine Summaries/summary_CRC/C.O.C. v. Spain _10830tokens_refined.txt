- Case Name: C.O.C. v. Spain

Procedural History:
The author, C.O.C., a national of the Gambia, filed a communication to the UNCRC claiming violations of the Convention on the Rights of the Child by Spain. The communication alleged that Spain failed to respect the author's right to be presumed a minor in the event of doubt or uncertainty and acted against his best interests.

Legal Analysis and Reasoning:
The author's communication alleged violations of the Convention's provisions related to the rights of children, specifically the right to be presumed a minor in the event of doubt or uncertainty. The communication also referenced the Committee's concluding observations on the State party, expressing concern about the lack of a uniform process for determining the best interests of the child in age assessment cases.

Decisions and Rulings:
The Committee found that Spain had violated several provisions of the CRC and the Optional Protocol, including articles 3, 8, 12, and 20(1) of the CRC, as well as article 6 of the Optional Protocol. The Committee noted that the author's age had not been properly determined, and that they had been denied access to a child protection center.

Impact and Significance:
This decision emphasizes the importance of protecting the rights of children and ensuring that they are treated fairly and with dignity. It also highlights the need for States to ensure that they have proper procedures in place for determining the age of young people claiming to be children, and for providing them with appropriate care and protection.
