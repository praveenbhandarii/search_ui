Summary:

Case Details:
- Case ID: CRC/C/85/D/92/2019
- Court/Tribunal: United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC)
- Document Date: 2 November 2020
- Key Parties Involved:
  - K.S.G. (author and mother of A.R.G.)
  - Spain (State party)
- Case Name: K.S.G. v. Spain
- Case Summary: The author, K.S.G., submitted a communication to the UNCRC on behalf of her son, A.R.G., who was allegedly sexually abused by his father. The communication claimed that the Spanish authorities had failed to protect A.R.G.'s rights by not granting precautionary measures to prevent the father from having contact with him. The UNCRC found that the Spanish courts had prioritized the father's right to presumption of innocence over A.R.G.'s right to protection and safety, and had not taken into account the best interests of the child.

Procedural History:
The case has been ongoing since 2017, with multiple legal proceedings and requests for precautionary measures. The author claims that the Spanish courts have prioritized the father's right to presumption of innocence over the child's rights, specifically his right to safety and best interests.

Legal Analysis and Reasoning:
The author invokes the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) and its Optional Protocol, which Spain has ratified. They argue that the State party has failed to ensure the child's best interests, as required by Article 3(1) of the CRC, and has violated the child's rights under Article 6(1) of the CRC, which includes the right to life, physical and psychological integrity, and protection against any kind of violence.

Decisions and Rulings:
The Committee found that the claim has not been sufficiently substantiated and declares it inadmissible under article 7 (f) of the Optional Protocol.

Impact and Significance:
This decision highlights the importance of ensuring that the best interests of the child are taken into account in all legal proceedings affecting children. It also underscores the need for States to protect children from all forms of violence, including sexual abuse, and to ensure their separation from abusers.
