Case Name: M.A.M. v. Switzerland

Procedural History:
The author, M.A.M., a national of Morocco, applied for asylum in Switzerland as an unaccompanied child. His application was rejected, and he was ordered to be returned to Morocco. The author alleged that the delay in processing his appeal constituted a violation of his rights under article 3 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child. The Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on a communications procedure was invoked, and the case was submitted to the Committee.

Legal Analysis and Reasoning:
The main issue in this case is whether the delay in processing the author's asylum appeal by the Swiss authorities violated his rights under Article 3 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child. The Committee considered the communication and observed that the author's social and family circle in Morocco would be willing and able to take care of him. The Committee held that the author had not substantiated his claims, and therefore, decided to discontinue the consideration of the communication.

Decisions and Rulings:
The Committee, having noted that the author was no longer at risk of being expelled to Morocco, concluded that the matter had become moot and decided to discontinue the consideration of communication No. 141/2021 in accordance with rule 26 of its rules of procedure under the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on a communications procedure.

Impact and Significance:
This case highlights the importance of ensuring that the rights of children are protected in the context of asylum proceedings. It emphasizes the need for States to ensure that children are not returned to a country where they may face a risk of harm or mistreatment. The case also underscores the importance of exhausting domestic remedies and substantiating claims in asylum cases involving children.
