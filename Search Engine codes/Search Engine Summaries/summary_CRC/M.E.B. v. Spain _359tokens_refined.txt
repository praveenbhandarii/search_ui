- Case Summary: The author, an unaccompanied migrant child, was required to undergo a medical age-determination test and was detained in a center for migrant adults. The Committee on the Rights of the Child considered the author's representative's request for discontinuance and decided to discontinue the consideration of communication No. 9/2017.

Procedural History:
The communication was submitted by M.E.B. on 1 February 2017 under the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on a communications procedure. The Committee considered the request for discontinuance and decided to discontinue the consideration of the communication.

Legal Analysis and Reasoning:
The CRC Committee did not provide any reasoning for their decision to discontinue the consideration of the communication. However, it is worth noting that the author's request for discontinuance may have been based on the fact that the medical age-determination test was no longer being pursued, rendering the communication moot.

Decisions and Rulings:
The Committee on the Rights of the Child decided to discontinue the consideration of communication No. 9/2017, in accordance with rule 26 of its rules of procedure under the Optional Protocol to the CRC on a communications procedure.

Impact and Significance:
This decision highlights the importance of ensuring that the rights of unaccompanied migrant children are protected, particularly in the context of age-determination processes. It also underscores the role of the CRC Committee in monitoring the implementation of the CRC and ensuring that states parties comply with their obligations under the Convention.
