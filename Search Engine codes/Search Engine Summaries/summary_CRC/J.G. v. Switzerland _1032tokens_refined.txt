Summary:

Case Details:
- Case ID: CRC/C/81/D/47/2018
- Court/Tribunal: United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC)
- Document Date: 28 June 2019
- Key Parties Involved: J.G. (author) vs. Switzerland (State party)
- Case Name: J.G. v. Switzerland
- Case Summary: J.G., a national of Angola, born in 2004, was diagnosed with a pervasive developmental disorder and required specialized treatment and schooling. He was denied asylum in Switzerland and was at risk of deportation to Angola. The author submitted a communication to the UNCRC claiming that his return to Angola would breach his rights under various articles of the Convention. Switzerland reopened the case and granted the author a residency permit, leading to the discontinuation of the consideration of the communication by the Committee.

Procedural History:
The communication was submitted on 15 June 2018, and the Committee requested Switzerland to refrain from deporting the author while the communication was pending. The State party later informed the Committee that it had granted the author a residency permit in Switzerland, leading to the discontinuation of the consideration of the communication.

Legal Analysis and Reasoning:
The main issue raised was whether the deportation of the author to Angola would breach his rights under the Convention on the Rights of the Child. The author argued that his deportation would breach his rights under various articles of the Convention. However, the Committee did not have the opportunity to consider the merits of the author's claims as the State party granted the author a residency permit before a decision was rendered.

Decisions and Rulings:
The Committee registered the communication and requested the State party to refrain from deporting the author while the communication was pending. The Committee later discontinued the consideration of the communication after the State party granted the author a residency permit in Switzerland.

Impact and Significance:
This case highlights the importance of the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on a communications procedure, providing individuals with a mechanism to submit complaints to the Committee alleging violations of their rights under the Convention. It also underscores the importance of States parties taking appropriate measures to ensure that children with disabilities have access to specialized treatment and schooling, as required by the Convention.
