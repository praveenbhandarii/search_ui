Summary:

Case Details:
- Case ID: CRC/C/87/D/75/2019
- Court/Tribunal: United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC)
- Document Date: 2021
- Key Parties Involved:
  - Party A: M.W. (author of the communication and father of the child)
  - Party B: Germany (State party)
- Case Name: M.W. v. Germany
- Case Summary: The author, M.W., a German national, submitted a communication to the UNCRC alleging that Germany had violated his daughter's rights under the Convention on the Rights of the Child by failing to enforce a judicially established contact regime between him and his child.

Procedural History:
The case involves a dispute between a father (M.W.) and a mother (V.W.) regarding the contact arrangements for their daughter. The father has been denied contact with his daughter since February 2018, despite court orders granting him visitation rights. The father alleges that the mother has violated the court orders and seeks a remedy for the lack of enforcement of the judicially established contact regime.

Legal Analysis and Reasoning:
The case involves the application of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) and the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on a communications procedure. The author alleges violations of Articles 3, 4, 5, 8, 9 (3), 12, 14, 16, 18, and 19 (c) of the Convention on the Rights of the Child. The main issue is whether the State party has failed to ensure the enforcement of the judicially established contact regime between the father and his daughter, and whether this failure constitutes a violation of the child's rights under the CRC.

Decisions and Rulings:
The Committee on the Rights of the Child found that the State party had violated the author's and his daughter's rights under the CRC by failing to ensure contact between them. The State party's failure to enforce the contact arrangement and revise it after the expiry of the contact ban resulted in the total loss of contact between the father and his daughter.

Impact and Significance:
This case highlights the importance of ensuring the enforcement of court orders related to child custody and the role of the state in protecting the rights of children. It also raises questions about the effectiveness of the communications procedure under the Optional Protocol and the ability of the Committee on the Rights of the Child to address violations of the CRC.
