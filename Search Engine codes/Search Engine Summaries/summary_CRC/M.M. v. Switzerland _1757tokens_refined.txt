  - State party: Switzerland
- Case Name: M.M. v. Switzerland
- Case Summary: M.M., a Ukrainian national, arrived in Switzerland at the age of 15 with his parents, who were failed asylum seekers. The author claims that his deportation to Ukraine would constitute a violation of his rights under various articles of the Convention on the Rights of the Child.

Procedural History:
The communication was submitted on 23 October 2019. The State party requested the Committee to discontinue its consideration of the communication, citing the author's temporary admission to the country. The Committee ultimately decided to discontinue the consideration of the communication, finding that the author was no longer at risk of being deported to Ukraine and that the communication was now moot.

Legal Analysis and Reasoning:
The Committee considered the admissibility of the communication and found that it was not inadmissible ratione temporis under Article 7(g) of the Optional Protocol. The main issue in this case is whether the deportation of M.M. to Ukraine would violate his rights under the Convention on the Rights of the Child.

Decisions and Rulings:
The Committee ultimately decided to discontinue the consideration of the communication, finding that the author was no longer at risk of being deported to Ukraine and that the communication was now moot.

Impact and Significance:
This case highlights the importance of ensuring that individuals who have been subject to violations of their human rights have access to effective remedies and protection. The decision in this case may have implications for similar cases where individuals are seeking protection from persecution or violence in their home countries.
