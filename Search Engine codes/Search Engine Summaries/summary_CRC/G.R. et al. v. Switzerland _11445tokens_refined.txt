Case Details:
- Case ID: CRC/C/87/D/86/2019
- Court/Tribunal: United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC)
- Document Date: 16 June 2021
- Key Parties Involved:
  - D.R. (represented by counsel, Sarah Vincent)
  - State party: Switzerland
- Case Name: D.R. v. Switzerland
- Case Summary: The case involves the deportation of a family, including two children, from Switzerland to Sri Lanka. The author, D.R., argues that their removal would violate their rights under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC), specifically articles 3 and 4. The author also raises issues under articles 6 (2), 24, and 37 (a) of the CRC, related to the best interests of the child, effective remedy, right to health, and torture and ill-treatment.

Procedural History:
The author and his family initially submitted their communication without legal representation but have been represented by counsel since August 2019. The working group on communications requested the State party to refrain from returning the author and his family to Sri Lanka while their case was under consideration. The State party's request for separate consideration of the communication's admissibility was rejected.

Legal Analysis and Reasoning:
The Committee has jurisdiction over the case under the Optional Protocol to the CRC. The author has exhausted domestic remedies and raised substantive issues related to the best interests of the child, access to medical care, and the risk of torture and ill-treatment. The main issue is whether the deportation would violate the family's rights under the CRC, particularly regarding the right to health and protection from torture and ill-treatment.

Decisions and Rulings:
The Committee found that the communication raised substantive issues under the CRC and was admissible. It concluded that the removal of the family to Sri Lanka would not result in a violation of their rights under the CRC.

Impact and Significance:
The case highlights the importance of considering the best interests of the child in deportation decisions and raises concerns about the risks faced by children with ongoing medical needs in countries with limited healthcare resources.
