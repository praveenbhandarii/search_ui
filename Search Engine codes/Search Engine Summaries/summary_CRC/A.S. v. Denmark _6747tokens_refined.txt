- Case Name: A.S. v. Denmark
- Case Summary: A.S., a minor, and his mother, both Pakistani nationals, are subject to a deportation order from Denmark. They claim that their deportation would violate their rights under articles 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, and 8 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child.

Procedural History:

- Jurisdiction and Competence: Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on a communications procedure

Legal Analysis and Reasoning:
- Legal Issues Addressed: Exhaustion of domestic remedies, prohibition of discrimination, best interest of the child, rights implementation, right to life, right of the child to be cared for by his parents, right of the child to preserve his identity
- Relevant Legal Provisions: Articles 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, and 8 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child
- Court's Analysis: A.S. argues that his deportation to Pakistan would put him at risk of persecution and threaten his life, and that his mother's deportation would also violate his rights under the CRC.

Decisions and Rulings:
- The Committee found that the author had not exhausted domestic remedies, but also found that the claim based on the best interests of the child was not manifestly ill-founded.

Impact and Significance:
- This case highlights the importance of protecting the rights of children under the CRC, particularly in cases of deportation. It also raises questions about the responsibility of States parties to the CRC to ensure that the best interests of the child are protected in such cases.
