Case Details:
- Case ID: CRC/C/74/D/5/2016
- Court/Tribunal: United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC)
- Document Date: 17 January 2017
- Key Parties Involved: J.A.B.S. (author) vs. Costa Rica
- Case Name: J.A.B.S. v. Costa Rica
- Case Summary: The author, a Costa Rican and United States citizen, submitted a communication to the UNCRC claiming that his twin sons, A.B.H. and M.B.H., born in the United States via in vitro fertilization, were denied the right to have their birth registered in the Costa Rican Civil Registry using the surnames assigned to them in the United States. The author alleges a violation of his sons' right to preserve their identity under article 8 of the Convention.

Procedural History:
The case concerns the registration of two boys' births in Costa Rica, where they were born to a Costa Rican father and a foreign mother. The Civil Registry refused to register the boys with their father's two surnames, citing Costa Rican law, which applies to children born out of wedlock.

Legal Analysis and Reasoning:
The CRC Committee considered the authors' request for interim measures for the provisional registration of his sons' birth in the Costa Rican Civil Registry using the surnames assigned to them in the United States. The Committee denied the request and determined that a consideration of admissibility did not require sending the communication back to the State party for its comments. The main issues in this case are whether the assignment of the father's two surnames to the boys violates their right to preserve their identity under Article 8 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, and whether the application of Costa Rican law by the national authorities was erroneous or constituted a denial of justice.

Decisions and Rulings:
The Committee on the Rights of the Child considered the author's claims and found them to be inadmissible under Article 7(f) of the Optional Protocol. The Committee noted that the author had not presented convincing arguments to demonstrate that the assignment of his two surnames to his children constituted a barrier to their ability to have full knowledge of their biological origins or failed to respect their right to preserve their identity.

Impact and Significance:
This decision is significant because it highlights the importance of protecting the rights of individuals under the Convention on the Rights of the Child, particularly those who may be vulnerable to discrimination or persecution. It also underscores the role of national authorities in interpreting and applying national legislation, and the limited scope of international human rights bodies to review such interpretations or applications.
