  - Spain (the state party)
- Case Name: J.A.B. v. Spain
- Case Summary: J.A.B., a citizen of Cameroon, claimed to be a victim of violations of several articles of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) by Spain. He alleged that he was not provided with adequate protection and care as a minor and that his rights under the CRC were violated.

Procedural History:
The case involved a minor, J.A.B., who arrived in Spain as an unaccompanied minor and was detained in a center for adults. The minor claimed to be a minor and provided a birth certificate and consular identity card as proof of his age. However, the prosecutor requested the minor to undergo age-determination tests, which he refused. The minor was subsequently declared to be an adult and expelled from the center for minors.

Legal Analysis and Reasoning:
The main legal issues in this case included the treatment of unaccompanied minors, the determination of their age, guardianship, and the right to legal representation. The Committee found that Spain had failed to protect J.A.B.'s rights as a minor and had violated several articles of the CRC. The Committee also highlighted the tension between the need to protect minors and the need to ensure that those claiming to be minors are indeed underage.

Decisions and Rulings:
The Committee found that Spain had violated J.A.B.'s rights as an unaccompanied minor under the CRC. The Committee based its decision on the provisions of the CRC, specifically Articles 2, 3, 6, 8, 12, 18(2), 20(1), 24, and 27.

Impact and Significance:
This case has significant implications for the treatment of unaccompanied minors in Spain and globally. It emphasizes the importance of protecting the rights of unaccompanied minors and ensuring that they are provided with adequate care and protection. The decision also serves as a reminder to States parties to take all necessary measures to ensure that the rights of children are protected.
