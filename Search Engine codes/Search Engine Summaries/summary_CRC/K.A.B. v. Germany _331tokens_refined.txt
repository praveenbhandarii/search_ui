- Case Summary: The case concerns undue delays in asylum proceedings, preventing a Syrian asylum seeker from requesting reunification with his family in Germany.

Procedural History:
The communication (No. 35/2017) was submitted by K.A.B., a Syrian asylum seeker, under the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on a communications procedure. The CRC Committee considered the request for discontinuance and decided to discontinue the consideration of communication No. 35/2017.

The issue at hand is the undue delay in asylum proceedings, preventing the author from requesting reunification with his family in Germany. The author claimed that this delay violated his rights under the Convention on the Rights of the Child, specifically Article 10 (family unity) and Article 22 (protection from refoulement). The CRC Committee found that the author's claims were not substantiated and did not warrant further consideration.

Decisions and Rulings:
The CRC Committee decided to discontinue the consideration of communication No. 35/2017, in accordance with Rule 26 of its Rules of Procedure under the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on a communications procedure.

Impact and Significance:
This decision highlights the importance of ensuring that asylum proceedings are conducted in a timely manner to avoid undue delays that can have negative impacts on the well-being of children and their families. It also underscores the importance of protecting the rights of children seeking asylum, particularly those related to family unity and protection from refoulement.
