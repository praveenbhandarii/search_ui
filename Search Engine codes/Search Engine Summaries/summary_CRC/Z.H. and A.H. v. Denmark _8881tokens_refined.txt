- Key Parties Involved: Z.H. and A.H. (represented by the non-governmental organization Asylret) vs. Denmark
- Case Name: Z.H. and A.H. v. Denmark
- Case Summary: The authors, Z.H. and A.H., are Albanian nationals seeking asylum in Denmark due to their involvement in a blood feud. They claim that their deportation to Albania would violate their children's rights under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC).

Procedural History:
The authors submitted their communication on 22 August 2017, and the decision was adopted on 18 September 2019. The case falls under the jurisdiction of the UNCRC, and the authors are represented by the non-governmental organization Asylret.

Legal Analysis and Reasoning:
The authors argue that their deportation would result in a violation of their children's rights under the CRC, specifically articles 3, 6, 19, 24, 27, and 28. They claim that the blood feud in Albania would put their lives at risk and harm their children's wellbeing. The State party argues that the communication should be declared inadmissible and that the authors have failed to exhaust domestic remedies.

Decisions and Rulings:
The Committee found that the authors had not provided sufficient substantiation for their claim of a real, specific, and personal risk of irreparable harm to their children's rights. They held that the authors had not demonstrated that the assessment of their application was arbitrary or amounted to a denial of justice.

Impact and Significance:
This decision emphasizes the importance of providing sufficient substantiation for claims of a real, specific, and personal risk of irreparable harm to children's rights. It also underscores the need to consider the best interests of the child in immigration decisions.
