Summary:

Case Details:
- Case ID: CRC/C/82/D/27/2017
- Court/Tribunal: United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC)
- Document Date: 5 November 2019
- Key Parties Involved:
  - R.K. (the author and victim)
  - Spain (the state party)
- Case Name: R.K. v. Spain

Procedural History:
The case involves R.K., a national of Guinea, who alleged violations of articles 3, 8, 12, 18 (2), 20, 22, 27, and 29 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child by Spain. The author claimed to be an unaccompanied asylum-seeking minor and requested protection measures. The communication was submitted to the Committee on the Rights of the Child on 20 July 2017.

Legal Analysis and Reasoning:
The legal issues in this case revolve around the assessment of the author's age, the State party's obligations under the Convention on the Rights of the Child, and the best interests of the child. The author argued that Spain failed to provide him with adequate protection and care as a minor and that his deportation was ordered without properly assessing his age. The State party's observations on admissibility focused on the author's age and the lack of reliable evidence to support his claim of being a minor.

Decisions and Rulings:
The Committee found that Spain violated the author's rights under the Convention on the Rights of the Child by failing to consider his best interests, denying him access to an identity, and subjecting him to an environment that was not conducive to the proper exercise of his right to be heard. The Committee also found that Spain's failure to apply an interim measure consisting of the author's transfer to a child protection center constituted a violation of the Optional Protocol to the CRC.

Impact and Significance:
This case highlights the importance of protecting the rights of unaccompanied minors seeking asylum and ensuring that their best interests are considered in all decisions related to their care and protection. It also emphasizes the need for States to ensure that age assessment procedures are fair, reliable, and conducted in accordance with the Convention on the Rights of the Child.
