Case Name: N.K. v. Norway

Procedural History:
The communication was submitted by N.K. (represented by her son, F.K.) against Norway, alleging a violation of articles 11(d) and (e) and 16(c) of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women. The case was initially submitted on 27 December 2013, and the decision on admissibility was adopted by the Committee at its sixty-fifth session on 7 November 2016.

Legal Analysis and Reasoning:
The legal issues addressed in the case included the alleged violation of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women by introducing conditions for a widow's pension that were not applicable to widowers, as well as the retroactive application of the amendments to the Marriage Act in breach of the Constitution and the European Convention on Human Rights. The Court analyzed the relevant legal provisions under the Convention and other international human rights instruments.

Decisions and Rulings:
The Committee found the communication inadmissible under Article 4(1) of the Optional Protocol, as the author had not exhausted all available domestic remedies. The Committee also noted that the author had not raised the issue of sex discrimination in her initial complaint or in her comments on the State party's submission.

Impact and Significance:
The decision set a precedent for the requirement to exhaust all available domestic remedies before submitting a communication to the Committee. It also highlighted the importance of raising all relevant legal claims and issues at the national level before seeking international intervention.
