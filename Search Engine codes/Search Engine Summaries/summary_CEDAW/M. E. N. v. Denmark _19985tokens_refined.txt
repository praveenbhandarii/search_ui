Combined Summary:

Case Details:
- Case ID: CEDAW/C/55/D/35/2011
- Court/Tribunal: United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women (UNCEDAW)
- Document Dates: Decision adopted by the Committee at its fifty-fifth session, 26 July 2013
- Key Parties Involved:
  - Party A: M. E. N. (the author and victim)
  - Party B: Denmark (the state party)
- Case Name: M. E. N. v. Denmark

Procedural History:
The case involves M. E. N., a Burundian national, who submitted a communication to the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women claiming that Denmark had violated her rights under the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women. The communication was considered at the Committee's fifty-fifth session on 26 July 2013.

Legal Analysis and Reasoning:
The main issues in the case revolve around the question of whether the State party's decision to return the author to Burundi would violate the provisions of the Convention, and whether the Committee has jurisdiction over the case. The State party argues that the Committee lacks jurisdiction and that the communication is incompatible with the provisions of the Convention, while the author argues that returning her to Burundi would put her at risk of persecution, citing the 2010 annual report on Burundi by Amnesty International.

Decisions and Rulings:
The Committee found that the author had sufficiently substantiated her claims and that the communication was admissible. The State party's arguments were dismissed, and the Committee ruled in favor of the author.

Impact and Significance:
The case sets a precedent for the extraterritorial application of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women and highlights the obligation of State parties to protect individuals from gender-based persecution, even in cases of deportation to a third country.

Citations and References:
The case references the United Nations Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW), the Optional Protocol to the Convention, and the Committee's general recommendations. It also cites the 2010 annual report on Burundi by Amnesty International as a key reference for the author's claims of persecution.
