Case Name: Guadalupe Herrera Rivera v. Canada

Procedural History:
The author, Guadalupe Herrera Rivera, a Mexican national, filed a communication against Canada with the Committee on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) claiming that Canada's refusal to grant her refugee status and subsequent removal to Mexico would expose her to a serious risk of discrimination and violence against women in Mexico. The State party, Canada, responded by challenging the admissibility of the communication, arguing that the author had failed to exhaust domestic remedies.

Legal Analysis and Reasoning:
The legal issues addressed in the case included whether the author had exhausted all available domestic remedies, whether the author's claims were speculative and lacked evidence, and whether the PRRA process was an effective remedy for the author's situation. The relevant legal provisions included articles 1, 2(a)(d), 5(a), and 24 of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW).

Decisions and Rulings:
The Committee on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) declared the author's communication inadmissible under Article 4, paragraph 2 (b) and (c) of the Optional Protocol to CEDAW, as the author had failed to exhaust domestic remedies and her allegations of discrimination were manifestly ill-founded and not sufficiently substantiated.

Impact and Significance:
The decision sets a precedent for the requirement of exhausting all available domestic remedies before filing a communication with the Committee. It also highlights the importance of substantiating allegations of discrimination with sufficient evidence.
