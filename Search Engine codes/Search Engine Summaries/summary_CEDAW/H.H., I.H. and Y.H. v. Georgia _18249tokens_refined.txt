- Case Summary: Khanum Jeiranova, an ethnic Azerbaijani woman, was brutally beaten and killed by her family members after being accused of adultery. Her husband, daughter, and son claim that Georgia is responsible for her death due to its failure to protect her from domestic violence and discrimination.

Procedural History:
The United Nations Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) Committee considered a complaint submitted by H.H., I.H. and Y.H. (represented by counsel) on behalf of Khanum Jeiranova, a Georgian national who died in 2014. The complaint alleged that Ms. Jeiranova's rights were violated by Georgia under Articles 1, 2(b)(f), and 5(a) of the Convention. The Optional Protocol entered into force for Georgia on November 1, 2002.

Legal Analysis and Reasoning:
The case addresses issues related to the violation of Ms. Jeiranova's rights under the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, specifically articles 2(c), (d), (e), and 5(a), read in conjunction with article 1. The authors argue that the State party's failure to protect Ms. Jeiranova's rights resulted in her death, and that the state is responsible for her killing. The State party disputes the admissibility of the communication and argues that the authors have not exhausted domestic remedies.

Decisions and Rulings:
The Committee found that the State party violated Ms. Jeiranova's rights under the Convention, particularly Article 2 (c) and (e), by failing to investigate and prevent her death. The State party's authorities were aware of the danger faced by Ms. Jeiranova but failed to take adequate measures to protect her. The Committee recommended that the State party carry out a prompt and independent investigation into Ms. Jeiranova's death and identify those responsible.

Impact and Significance:
The case sets a precedent for addressing gender-based violence and honor-based discrimination. It highlights the need for effective investigations and prosecutions of honor crimes and the importance of considering the intersectionality of gender, ethnicity, and religion in addressing such cases.

Citations and References:
The Committee's general recommendations No. 19 and No. 28 were cited, emphasizing the State party's due diligence obligation to prevent, investigate, prosecute, and punish acts of gender-based violence. The recommendations for the State party to combat gender-based violence against women and honor-based violence were also included.
