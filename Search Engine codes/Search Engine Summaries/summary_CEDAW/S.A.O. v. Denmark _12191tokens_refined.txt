Combined Summary:

Case Details:
- Case ID: CEDAW/C/71/D/101/2016
- Court/Tribunal: United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women (UNCEDAW)
- Document Date: 29 October 2018
- Key Parties Involved:
  - Party A: S.A.O. (the author and victim, represented by counsel, NielsErik Hansen)
  - Party B: Denmark
- Case Name: S.A.O. v. Denmark
- Case Summary: S.A.O., a Somali national, sought asylum in Denmark in 2014 but her application was rejected. She claims that her deportation to Somalia would violate articles 2 (d), 12, 15 and 16 of the Convention, read together with the principle of non-refoulement.

Procedural History:
The communication was submitted by S.A.O. (represented by counsel, Niels-Erik Hansen) to the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) on 7 December 2015. The State party, Denmark, provided its observations on admissibility and merits via a note verbale dated 11 August 2016.

Legal Analysis and Reasoning:
The legal issues addressed in the case include the violation of rights under the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) and the principle of non-refoulement. The State party argued that the author failed to establish a prima facie case for admissibility and that her deportation would not amount to a violation of the Convention. The State party also emphasized the assessment of the author's credibility by the Refugee Appeals Board.

Decisions and Rulings:
The Committee found the communication admissible under the Optional Protocol, but part of the communication related to the author's claims under articles 12 and 15 was found inadmissible. The Committee requested the State party to provide information on the author's claims under articles 2(d), 12, 15, and 16 of the Convention, and to address the issue of gender-based violence and discrimination in Somalia.

Impact and Significance:
The case sets a precedent for the consideration of gender-based persecution in asylum applications and highlights the importance of assessing asylum claims in the light of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women.
