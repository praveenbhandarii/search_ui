Case Details:
- Case ID: CEDAW/C/60/D/51/2013
- Court/Tribunal: United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women (UNCEDAW)
- Document Dates: 2015
- Key Parties Involved:
  - Party A: Y.W. (the author and victim, represented by counsel, Niels-Erik Hansen)
  - Party B: Denmark
- Case Name: Y.W. v. Denmark

Procedural History:
The author, Y.W., a Chinese national, sought asylum in Denmark due to threats, rape, and forced prostitution by criminals in China. Her application was rejected, and she was awaiting deportation. She claimed that her deportation would constitute a violation of her rights under the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women. The communication was considered at the sixtieth session of the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women.

Legal Analysis and Reasoning:
The legal issues addressed in the case included lack of substantiation, deportation to China, non-refoulement, gender-based violence, and access to justice. The relevant legal provisions were Articles 1, 2, 3, 12, and 15 of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women. The Committee analyzed the admissibility of the communication separately from its merits, considering the author's claims and the State party's observations on admissibility.

Decisions and Rulings:
The Committee found that the author had exhausted all domestic remedies and that her deportation to China would constitute a violation of her rights under the Convention. It recommended that Denmark refrain from deporting the author to China and ensure that she has access to an effective remedy, including compensation and rehabilitation.

Impact and Significance:
The decision set a precedent for the protection of women seeking asylum from gender-based violence and discrimination. It emphasized the importance of a gender-sensitive approach in the asylum process and the need for dignified and non-discriminatory return processes for women asylum seekers.
