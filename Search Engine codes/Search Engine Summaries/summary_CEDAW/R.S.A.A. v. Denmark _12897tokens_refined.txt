- Case Summary: The authors, Palestinian refugees from the Syrian Arab Republic, claim that their deportation from Denmark to Jordan would violate their rights under the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women.

Procedural History:
- The authors' application for asylum was rejected by the Danish Immigration Service, and the Refugee Appeals Board dismissed the appeal.
- The Committee requested the State party to refrain from deporting the authors to Jordan pending the consideration of their case.
- The Refugee Appeals Board suspended the time limit for the departure of the authors from Denmark until further notice, in accordance with the Committee's request.

Legal Analysis and Reasoning:
- The authors claimed violations under articles 1, 2 (d), 2 (e), 2 (f), and 15 (4) of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women.
- The State party argued that the communication should be declared inadmissible under article 4 (2) (c) of the Optional Protocol, owing to a lack of substantiation.

Decisions and Rulings:
- The Committee found that the State party failed to give sufficient consideration to the real, personal, and foreseeable risk of serious forms of gender-based violence faced by the authors.
- The Committee recommended that the State party reopen the asylum case of the authors and refrain from forcibly returning them to Jordan.

Impact and Significance:
- The Committee's views and recommendations have implications for the protection of refugee women and the consideration of gender-based violence in asylum applications.
