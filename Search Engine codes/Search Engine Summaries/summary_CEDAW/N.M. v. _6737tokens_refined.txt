Case Name: N.M. v. Turkey
Case Summary: N.M., a citizen of Singapore, alleges violations by Turkey of articles 2, 3, 15 and 16 of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women. The author claims that she was a victim of discrimination and violence by her husband, who abducted their two daughters and took them to Turkey. The author seeks return of the children to her care and compensation.

Procedural History:
The author, N.M., a citizen of Singapore, born in 1976, submits a communication to the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) against Turkey. The author is represented by counsel, Howard Kennedy. The Convention and the Optional Protocol thereto entered into force for Turkey on 20 December 1985 and on 29 October 2002, respectively.

Legal Analysis and Reasoning:
The case involves allegations of violations of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, including issues of child abduction, domestic violence, and discrimination against women. The author claims that the Turkish legal system is biased towards Turkish men as the heads of family, to whom responsibility for children is given, and that she was discriminated against because she is a woman and a foreigner.

Decisions and Rulings:
The Committee declares that the part of the communication related to the author's failure to exhaust domestic remedies is inadmissible under Article 4(1) of the Optional Protocol. The Committee concludes that the author has not provided sufficient information and explanations in support of her claims under the Convention, and therefore declares that that part of the communication is inadmissible under Article 4(2)(c) of the Optional Protocol. The Committee decides that the communication is inadmissible under Articles 4(1) and (2)(c) of the Optional Protocol.

Impact and Significance:
The decision sets a precedent for the admissibility of communications related to the exhaustion of domestic remedies and the provision of sufficient information and explanations in support of claims under the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women.
