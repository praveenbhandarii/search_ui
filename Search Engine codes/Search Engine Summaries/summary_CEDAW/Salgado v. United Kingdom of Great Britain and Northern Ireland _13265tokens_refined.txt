- Case Summary: The author, a British citizen, claims that she was prevented from transmitting her British nationality to her eldest son by descent, in violation of Articles 1, 2(f), and 9, paragraph 2, of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women.

Procedural History:
- The author, Ms. Constance Ragan Salgado, submitted the communication on 11 April 2005.
- The State party, United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, responded to the communication on 23 April 2007.
- The Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) considered the communication inadmissible under article 4, paragraph 1, of the Optional Protocol due to the author's failure to exhaust domestic remedies.

Legal Analysis and Reasoning:
- Legal Issues Addressed: Sex-based discrimination in the transmission of nationality by descent, in violation of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women.
- Relevant Legal Provisions: Articles 1, 2(f), and 9, paragraph 2, of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women.
- Court's Analysis: The State party argued that the author's claim is inadmissible due to the temporal limitations of the Convention, as the events in question occurred before the UK's ratification of the Convention.

Decisions and Rulings:
- The Committee decided that the communication was inadmissible under article 4, paragraph 2 (e), of the Optional Protocol because the disputed facts occurred prior to the entry into force of the Optional Protocol for the State party and did not continue after that date.
- The Committee also found that the communication was inadmissible under article 4, paragraph 1, of the Optional Protocol because of the author's failure to exhaust domestic remedies.

Impact and Significance:
- The decision sets a precedent for the admissibility of communications under the Optional Protocol, emphasizing the requirement to exhaust domestic remedies and the temporal limitations of the Protocol.
