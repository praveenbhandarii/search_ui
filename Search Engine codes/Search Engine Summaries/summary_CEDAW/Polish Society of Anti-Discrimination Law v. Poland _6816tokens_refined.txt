Case Name: Polish Society of Anti-Discrimination Law v. Poland

Procedural History:
The Polish Society of Anti-Discrimination Law (PSADL) submitted a communication to the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) alleging that Poland had violated its rights under the Convention. The communication was registered on November 27, 2018, and the Committee's Working Group on Communications under the Optional Protocol granted Poland's request to split the consideration of the admissibility and merits of the communication on April 5, 2019.

Legal Analysis and Reasoning:
The case revolves around a book containing harmful passages trivializing and promoting rape. PSADL lodged a notification of crime with the District Prosecutors Office for Warsaw, which was refused. The Third Criminal Division of the District Court for Warsaw issued a decision revoking the prosecutor's decision and forwarding the case for re-examination. After the prosecutor re-examined the case, PSADL was notified that the investigation had been discontinued. PSADL argued that the subject of protection in cases involving praise for a crime was a matter of public order, rather than a matter of the personal interests of any specific person.

Decisions and Rulings:
The Committee found that the communication was admissible under the Optional Protocol and that Poland had violated its obligations under the Convention. The Committee noted that the author had exhausted all domestic remedies and had raised the claim before the Committee, providing the domestic authorities with an opportunity to address the claim.

Impact and Significance:
The decision sets a precedent for cases involving discrimination against women and the protection of public order. It highlights the importance of exhausting all domestic remedies and the role of the Committee in addressing claims under the Optional Protocol.
