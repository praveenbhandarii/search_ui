Procedural History:
The case involves G.H., a Hungarian national of Roma origin, who alleged that her rights under the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women were violated by Hungary due to her involuntary sterilization without informed consent. The communication was submitted on 23 February 2017, and the decision was adopted by the Committee on 6 July 2020.

Legal Analysis and Reasoning:
The legal issues addressed in the case include gender-based discrimination, lack of informed consent regarding sterilization, and violation of specific articles of the Convention. The Court analyzed the substantive and procedural issues, considering the lack of substantiation and the alleged violations of the Convention.

Decisions and Rulings:
The Committee found that the communication was inadmissible under article 4(2)(c) of the Optional Protocol. The State party's arguments were considered, and it was noted that the domestic courts had acknowledged the author's victim status and established that the sterilization was carried out without written consent. However, the Committee found that this did not constitute a breach of the obligation of equal treatment.

Impact and Significance:
The case sets a precedent for addressing gender-based discrimination and lack of informed consent in sterilization procedures. It highlights the importance of fully informed consent and the need for effective judicial remedies in cases of involuntary sterilization.
