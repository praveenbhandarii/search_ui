- Court/Tribunal: United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women (UNCEDAW)
- Document Date: 11 March 2022
- Key Parties Involved:
  - Party A: Jeremy Eugene Matson (not represented by counsel) and his children, I.D.M. and A.M.M. (alleged victims)
  - Party B: Canada (State party)
- Case Name: Matson v. Canada
- Case Summary: Jeremy Eugene Matson, a member of the indigenous Squamish Nation, alleges that Canada has violated the rights of himself and his children under articles 1, 2, and 3 of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) by denying them indigenous status, the right to determine their indigenous identity, and their fundamental right to belong to a group of indigenous people.

Procedural History:
The Optional Protocol entered into force for Canada on 18 January 2003. The author, Jeremy Eugene Matson, submitted the communication on 18 October 2013. The State party has requested the Committee to suspend consideration of the communication several times, citing ongoing legislative changes and court cases related to the issue.

Legal Analysis and Reasoning:
The communication alleges that the Canadian government's laws and policies, including the Indian Act, have discriminated against indigenous women and their descendants, denying them their right to determine their own identity and access to rights and benefits. The State party argues that the communication should be found inadmissible under Article 2 of the Optional Protocol because the author, as a man, cannot claim to be a victim of violations under the Convention. The State party also argues that the communication is inadmissible owing to the non-exhaustion of domestic remedies.

Decisions and Rulings:
The Committee has found the communication admissible under the Optional Protocol and has determined that the descendants of indigenous women who lost their indigenous status and the right to determine their own identity due to gender inequalities unilaterally established by the State party qualify as direct victims under the Optional Protocol.

Impact and Significance:
The Committee's decision to find the communication admissible sets a precedent for addressing gender-based discrimination in the Indian Act and has implications for the rights of indigenous women and their descendants in Canada. The Committee's recommendations for the State party to provide appropriate reparation to the author and his children, including recognizing them as indigenous people with full legal capacity to transmit their indigenous status and identity to their descendants, have broader legal impact on indigenous rights in Canada.
