- Case Name: Natalia M. Alonzo et al. v. The Philippines
- Case Summary: The authors, 24 Filipina nationals, bring a complaint against the Philippines for violating their rights under articles 1, 2 (b) and (c) and 6 of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women. The authors claim that they were subjected to sexual slavery by the Imperial Japanese Army during World War II and that the Philippine government has failed to provide them with adequate financial compensation.

Procedural History:
The authors, represented by counsel, submitted the communication to the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) in 2020. The Committee's Working Group on Communications under the Optional Protocol examined the admissibility and merits of the communication on October 26, 2020. The State party argued that the communication should be declared inadmissible because the facts of the case occurred prior to the entry into force of the Optional Protocol for the Philippines.

Legal Analysis and Reasoning:
The legal issues addressed in the case include the admissibility of the communication, violation of rights under the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, and the State party's failure to provide adequate reparations. The relevant legal provisions include Articles 1, 2 (b) and (c), and 6 of the Convention. The Court analyzed the continuous nature of the discrimination against the authors and the State party's obligations under the Convention.

Decisions and Rulings:
The Committee found that the State party has violated the authors' rights under articles 1 and 2 (b) and (c) of the Convention. The Committee concluded that the State party has breached its obligations under the Convention and has failed to fulfill its obligations to provide redress, compensation, and rehabilitation to the authors.

Impact and Significance:
The case sets a precedent for the continuous nature of discrimination and the State party's obligations to provide adequate reparations to victims of sexual slavery. It highlights the need for accountability and reparations for victims of sexual violence in conflict situations.
