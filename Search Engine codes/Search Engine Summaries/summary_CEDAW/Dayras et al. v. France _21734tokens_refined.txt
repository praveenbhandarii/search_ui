- Case Name: Michle Dayras et al. v. France

Procedural History:
The authors, seven French nationals represented by SOS Sexisme, claim that France has violated the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women by denying them the right to transmit their family names to their children. The communication was submitted to the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) on 13 February 2007. The State party, France, has challenged the admissibility of the communication on several grounds.

Legal Analysis and Reasoning:
The authors argue that the French legislation on family names violates the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) by denying them the right to transmit their family names to their children. They claim that the Act of 4 March 2002 on family names, amended by the Act of 18 June 2003, is discriminatory towards married women because it gives fathers the right to veto the transmission of the family name of their wives to their children. The State party challenges the admissibility of the communication on the grounds of incompatibility with Article 16, paragraph 1 (g), of the Convention, and non-exhaustion of domestic remedies.

Decisions and Rulings:
The Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) finds that the communication is inadmissible due to the non-exhaustion of domestic remedies. The Committee also concludes that the communication is inadmissible in relation to all eight authors.

Impact and Significance:
The decision sets a precedent for future cases involving the transmission of family names and the admissibility of communications to the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women. It highlights the importance of exhausting domestic remedies before seeking international intervention.

Citations and References:
