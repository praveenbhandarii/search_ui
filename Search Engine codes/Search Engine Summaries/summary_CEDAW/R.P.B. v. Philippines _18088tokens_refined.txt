B., a Filipina national born in 1989, claims to be the victim of a violation by the State party of article 1 and article 2 (c), (d) and (f) of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women. She was raped by a neighbor when she was 17 years old and deaf and mute. The author submits that the hearings scheduled for 2006 were not held owing to the unavailability of the prosecution witnesses, and only on 15 January 2007 did the first prosecution witness, the author's mother, testify in court.

Procedural History:
- The author's case was filed with the Regional Trial Court of Pasig City, Metro Manila in July 2006.
- The perpetrator was charged with qualified rape aggravated by the circumstances of treachery, abuse of superior strength, nighttime, and dwelling.
- The court hearings were delayed due to the unavailability of prosecution witnesses, and an interpreter was requested for the private complainant, who is deaf and mute.

Legal Analysis and Reasoning:
- The author alleges that the State party violated her rights under CEDAW by failing to provide her with adequate protection from discrimination and violence.
- The author claims that the police officer's conduct during the interview violated her rights under Republic Act No. 8505.
- The lack of interpretation services during legal proceedings was also cited as a violation of her rights under CEDAW and Republic Act No. 8369.

Decisions and Rulings:
- The Regional Trial Court of Pasig City acquitted the accused on January 31, 2011, based on principles derived from previous case law of the Supreme Court.
- The court challenged the credibility of the victim's testimony and found that she had failed to prove that the sexual intercourse was not consensual.

Impact and Significance:
- The case highlights the challenges faced by deaf and mute individuals in accessing justice and protection from discrimination and violence.
- It sets a precedent for the provision of interpretation services and accommodations for individuals with disabilities in legal proceedings.
