Procedural History:
The author, Inga Abramova, filed a complaint with the CEDAW Committee against Belarus in 2009, alleging violations of her rights under the Convention. She claimed that her complaints to domestic authorities and courts were rejected, and she had exhausted all available domestic remedies.

The CEDAW Committee examined the communication and found that Abramova's allegations of degrading treatment, including lack of privacy, inadequate living conditions, and gender-based discrimination, constituted violations of the Convention. The Committee also noted the failure of the State party to address the specific claims under the Convention.

Decisions and Rulings:
The CEDAW Committee found that Belarus violated Abramova's rights under the Convention and recommended immediate measures to ensure adequate living conditions and conformity with the provisions of the Convention.

Impact and Significance:
