- Document Date: 23 February 2023
- Key Parties Involved: Oksana Shpagina (deceased), represented by counsel, Tatiana Kochetkova and Mikhail Golichenko; Russian Federation
- Case Name: Oksana Shpagina (deceased) v. Russian Federation
- Case Summary: Oksana Shpagina, a national of the Russian Federation, claimed that the State party violated her rights guaranteed under articles 2 (f) and (g), 3 and 12 of the Convention, by failing to provide her with evidence-based, gender-sensitive drug dependence treatment, notably opioid substitution therapy, and subjecting her to severe criminal sanctions, including imprisonment, for activities related to drug use.

Procedural History:
The author, Oksana Shpagina, filed a communication with the United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women (UNCEDAW) on 25 March 2018, alleging violations of her rights under the Convention. The State party, Russian Federation, responded to the communication, denying the allegations and asserting that the author's rights had not been violated.

Legal Analysis and Reasoning:
The case addressed issues related to lack of access to evidence-based, gender-sensitive drug dependence treatment for pregnant women, discrimination against women in the provision of healthcare services, severe criminal sanctions for activities related to drug use, and failure of the State party to provide adequate social support for women with drug dependence. The legal provisions under consideration were articles 2 (f) and (g), 3, and 12 of the Convention.

Decisions and Rulings:
The Committee found that the State party had violated the author's rights under Article 12 and Articles 2(f) and (g) and 3, read in conjunction with Article 12 of the Convention. The Committee made recommendations to the State party, including providing full reparation to the author's daughter, reviewing and amending legislation to prevent discrimination against women in healthcare, and putting in place clinical protocols and guidelines for gender-sensitive drug dependence treatment.

Impact and Significance:
The Committee's decision sets a precedent for addressing discrimination against women in accessing healthcare services, particularly in the context of drug dependence treatment during pregnancy. The recommendations made to the State party have broader legal implications for ensuring gender-sensitive healthcare and preventing discrimination against women.
