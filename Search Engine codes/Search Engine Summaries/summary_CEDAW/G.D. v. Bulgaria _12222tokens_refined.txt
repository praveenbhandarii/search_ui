Case Details:

- Court/Tribunal: United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women (UNCEDAW)
- Document Date: 2021
- Key Parties Involved: G.D. (represented by counsel, Milena Kadieva) vs. Bulgaria
- Case Name: G.D. v. Bulgaria
- Case Summary: G.D., a Bulgarian national, complained to the UNCEDAW about violations by Bulgaria of articles 2 (c), 5 (b), 15 and 16, read in conjunction with article 1, of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women. The author submits that the State party failed to provide her and her children with effective protection against domestic violence by treating her unequally before the law, as a result of which her custodial rights over her children were revoked and granted to the children's allegedly violent father.

Procedural History:
The Optional Protocol entered into force for Bulgaria on 20 December 2006. The author is represented by counsel, Milena Kadieva. The case involves a divorce proceedings agreement reached by the author and her husband, whereupon their marriage was dissolved and the custodial rights regarding their minor children were assigned to the mother. The father was granted visiting rights and was ordered to pay child maintenance on a monthly basis. The author's ex-husband later initiated court proceedings against the author for the custodial rights over their two minor children, and to oblige her to pay child maintenance for the children.

Legal Analysis and Reasoning:
The main issues addressed in the case include domestic violence, discrimination against women, equality before the law, and the best interests of the children. The author alleged violations of her rights under Articles 2(c), 5(b), 15, and 16 of the Convention, read in conjunction with Article 1, due to the State's failure to provide her and her children with effective protection against domestic violence. The State party disputed the author's claims, stating that social workers investigated the matter and found no evidence of violence by the father against the children.

Decisions and Rulings:
The Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women decided that the State party failed to provide the author and her children with effective protection against domestic violence, thereby violating articles 2(c), 5(b), 15, and 16 of the Convention, read in conjunction with article 1. The Committee required the State party to suspend the judicial proceedings initiated for implementing the final court decision placing the children with their father and ensure that meetings between the children and their father take place in a safe environment.

Impact and Significance:
The decision sets a precedent for cases involving domestic violence and child custody disputes, emphasizing the importance of providing sufficient evidence to support allegations of gender-based discrimination and unequal treatment before the law, particularly in cases involving child custody disputes.
