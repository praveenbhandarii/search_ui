- Case Summary: M.C., a Pakistani national, sought asylum in Denmark but her application was rejected. She claimed that her deportation to Pakistan would constitute a violation of her rights under the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women.

Procedural History:
The case was submitted by M.C. (represented by counsel, Helge Nrrung) to the United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women (UNCEDAW) on 9 July 2013. The Committee considered the admissibility of the communication separately from its merits and found it inadmissible under Article 4(2) of the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (OP-CEDAW).

Legal Analysis and Reasoning:
The legal issues addressed in the case included the admissibility of the communication and the alleged violation of rights under the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women. The relevant legal provisions were Articles 1, 2, 3, 5, and 16 of the Convention. The Committee's analysis focused on the substantiation of the claim and the evidence provided by M.C.

Decisions and Rulings:
The CEDAW Committee declared M.C.'s communication inadmissible under Article 4(2) of the OP-CEDAW. The Committee noted that M.C.'s return to Pakistan did not constitute a violation of her rights under the Convention or General Recommendation No. 19, as she had not provided sufficient evidence to support her claims of fear of persecution or violence.

Impact and Significance:
The decision sets a precedent for the level of evidence required to substantiate claims of fear of persecution or violence under the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women. It also highlights the importance of providing specific and detailed evidence to support asylum claims based on gender-based violence.
