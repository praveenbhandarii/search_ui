Case Name: PromoLEX v. Republic of Moldova

Procedural History:
The communication was submitted by PromoLEX on behalf of V.C., a deceased Moldovan national who was a victim of domestic violence. The State party, Republic of Moldova, did not contest the admissibility of the communication. The Committee found the communication admissible and proceeded with its examination on the merits.

Legal Analysis and Reasoning:
The case addressed the State party's alleged violations of V.C.'s rights under article 2(a), (c), (e), and (f) of the Convention, read in conjunction with article 1. The author argued that the State party failed to protect V.C. from domestic violence and provide her with effective legal protection, counseling, and rehabilitation services. The State party highlighted legislative changes and measures taken to address domestic violence, but the author disputed their observations, claiming they did not address the core complaints made in relation to the violation of the Convention.

Decisions and Rulings:
The Committee found that the State party violated V.C.'s rights under the Convention and made recommendations for posthumous acknowledgment of her status as a victim of domestic violence, thorough investigation of allegations, and provision of access to effective remedies for victims of domestic violence.

Impact and Significance:
The decision sets a precedent for holding State parties accountable for failing to protect victims of domestic violence and provides guidance on measures to prevent and combat gender-based violence against women.
