- Case Name: G.M.N.F. v. the Netherlands
- Case Summary: The author, G.M.N.F., submits that the Netherlands has breached articles 1, 2 (a)(d), 6, 9 (1) and (2), 15 (1), (2) and (4) and 16 (c), (d) and (g) of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women. The case concerns the authors daughter, J.J.F.H., who was born in 2004 in the United States, and her mothers, A.M.F.A., rights to protection against discrimination and violence, and the right to family life.

Procedural History:
- The Committee requested the State party to take interim measures to ascertain the exact whereabouts of the authors daughter in the United States, ensure her safety and security, and ensure access of the author to her daughter and their effective and regular communication, pending the examination of the present communication by the Committee.

Legal Analysis and Reasoning:
- The case involves a dispute between a mother (the author) and her ex-husband (H.) over the custody of their daughter (J.J.F.H.).
- The mother and daughter are currently residing in the Netherlands, where they have been receiving treatment for trauma related to alleged abuse by the father.
- The father has been accused of abusing J.J.F.H. and the mother has submitted multiple reports supporting these allegations.

Decisions and Rulings:
- The Committee decides to examine the admissibility of the communication together with its merits and maintains its request for interim measures.
- The State party challenges the admissibility of the communication, arguing that the facts as submitted do not involve discrimination based on sex and that the available remedies in the Netherlands would have been unduly prolonged or unable to bring the author effective relief.

Impact and Significance:
- The case highlights the importance of protecting the rights of women and children in cases of alleged abuse and discrimination.
- The decisions and rulings in this case may set precedents for future cases involving international child abduction and discrimination against women.
