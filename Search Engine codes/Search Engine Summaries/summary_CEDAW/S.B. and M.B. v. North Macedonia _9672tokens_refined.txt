Case Details:

- Document Dates: 2020
- Key Parties Involved:
  - S.B. and M.B. (represented by counsel, Natasha Boshkova) vs. North Macedonia
- Case Name: S.B. and M.B. v. North Macedonia

Procedural History:
The authors, S.B. and M.B., both Roma women from North Macedonia, alleged that they were denied access to gynaecological services at a private healthcare facility due to their ethnicity, and that this denial is a form of discrimination against women. They claimed that the State party has failed to introduce positive measures in favor of the sexual and reproductive rights of Roma women, resulting in inequality in practice in the authors' enjoyment of their right to health.

Legal Analysis and Reasoning:
The Committee found that the State party violated the authors' rights under Article 2 (a), (c), and (e) of CEDAW by failing to ensure their equal access to healthcare services. The authors faced intersecting forms of discrimination based on their gender, ethnicity, and socio-economic status. The State party failed to provide adequate remedies to the authors and failed to take appropriate positive measures to eliminate the discriminatory practice.

Decisions and Rulings:
The Committee declared the communication admissible and proceeded with consideration of the merits. It recommended that the State party adopt temporary special measures to address the multiple forms of discrimination faced by Roma women, including in the area of healthcare.

Impact and Significance:
The case sets a precedent for addressing intersecting forms of discrimination and the need for specific and effective policies, programs, and targeted measures to combat discrimination against Roma women and girls, including in healthcare.
