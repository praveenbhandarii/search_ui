- Key Parties Involved:
  - Party A: M. S. (the author and victim, represented by counsel, H. Harry L. Roque Jr.)
  - Party B: The Philippines
- Case Name: M. S. v. The Philippines
- Case Summary: M. S., a Filipina born in 1951, alleges that the Philippines violated articles 1, 2 (c) and (f), 5 (a) and 11 (1)(f) of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women. The author claims to be a victim of discrimination and harassment by her employer, a telecommunications corporation, and its executives, including Mr. G, who made unwelcome sexual advances towards her and subjected her to sexual harassment and assault.

Procedural History:
- The communication was submitted by M. S. (represented by counsel, H. Harry L. Roque Jr.) on 10 February 2011
- The communication was transmitted to the State party on 4 April 2011
- The Committee considered the communication at its fifty-eighth session (30 June - 18 July 2014)
- Decision adopted on 16 July 2014
- Individual opinion (dissenting) by Committee member Patricia Schulz appended to the document

Legal Analysis and Reasoning:
- The communication alleged violations of Articles 1, 2(c) and (f), 5(a), and 11(1)(f) of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women
- The author claimed that the Supreme Court's decision in her case involved discrimination against her on account of her gender and that the State party had failed to provide her with an effective remedy for the sexual violence she suffered in the workplace
- The author also argued that the Supreme Court's decision was defective on grounds other than gender discrimination and that the Court failed to consider the professional and sexual harassment that the Court of Appeals had extensively discussed

Decisions and Rulings:
- The Committee declared the communication admissible and found that the author had sufficiently substantiated her claims of violation of CEDAW provisions by the Philippines
- The Committee found that the Supreme Court's decision in the author's case was based on gender myths and stereotypes, and failed to consider the psychological effects of sexual violence, power relations between employer and employee, and social and cultural influences
- Individual opinion of Committee member Patricia Schulz dissented from the Committee's decision, arguing that the communication should be declared admissible

Impact and Significance:
- The decision of the Committee to declare the communication admissible sets a precedent for addressing gender-based discrimination and sexual harassment in the workplace under the CEDAW provisions
- The dissenting opinion highlights the ongoing debate and differing perspectives on the admissibility of communications related to gender discrimination and sexual harassment
