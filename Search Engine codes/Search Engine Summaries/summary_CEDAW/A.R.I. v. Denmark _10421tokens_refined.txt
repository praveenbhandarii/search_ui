  - Party B: Denmark
- Case Name: A.R.I. v. Denmark

Procedural History:
The author, A.R.I., a citizen of the Russian Federation, sought asylum in Denmark after fleeing from the armed conflict in Chechnya. She claimed that her deportation to the Russian Federation would violate her rights under article 2 (c) (f) and article 5 (a) of the Convention. The communication was received by the CEDAW on 17 September 2015 and registered on 22 September 2015. The Danish Refugee Appeals Board suspended the author's deportation on 24 September 2015.

Legal Analysis and Reasoning:
The legal issues addressed in the case include the risk of persecution, torture, and inhumane treatment faced by the author if deported to Russia. The relevant legal provisions are article 2 (c) (f) and article 5 (a) of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW). The Committee analyzed the author's claims and the State party's arguments to determine the admissibility of the communication.

Decisions and Rulings:
The Committee found that the communication was inadmissible under Article 4(2)(c) of the Optional Protocol to CEDAW. It noted that the State party's authorities had properly assessed the risks that the author would face if deported to the Russian Federation. The Committee communicated its decision to the State party and the author.

Impact and Significance:
The decision sets a precedent for the assessment of asylum claims based on gender-based persecution and the application of the CEDAW in such cases. It highlights the importance of proper assessment by national authorities and the need for substantial evidence to support claims of persecution.
