- Key Parties Involved: D.N.S. (represented by counsel, NielsErik Hansen) vs. Denmark
- Case Name: D.N.S. v. Denmark
- Case Summary: D.N.S., a national of Somalia, sought asylum in Denmark, which was rejected. She claims that her deportation would amount to a violation by Denmark of her rights under articles 2, 3, and 12 of the Convention.

Procedural History:
The author, D.N.S., sought asylum in Denmark, which was rejected. The case was brought before the United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women (UNCEDAW) under communication No. 144/2019. The author was represented by counsel, NielsErik Hansen, and the state party involved was Denmark.

Legal Analysis and Reasoning:
The legal issues addressed in the case included the alleged violation of rights under articles 2, 3, and 12 of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW). The author claimed fear of persecution, including female genital mutilation, and lack of protection in Somalia. The Committee analyzed the inconsistencies in the author's statements and the likelihood of her having substantial connections in Somalia.

Decisions and Rulings:
The Committee found that the author's claims were not sufficiently substantiated and were therefore inadmissible under Article 4(2)(c) of the Optional Protocol. It noted that the author provided contradictory information about her close family and failed to establish that she would be unable to live with relatives in Somalia or that she would have no network there. The communication was deemed not sufficiently substantiated and was therefore inadmissible.

Impact and Significance:
The decision sets a precedent for the level of substantiation required in asylum cases brought before the UNCEDAW. It emphasizes the importance of providing consistent and credible information to support claims of persecution and lack of protection in the home country.
