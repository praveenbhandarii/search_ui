Procedural History:
The author, a Spanish national, submitted a communication to the UNCEDAW alleging a violation of Articles 2(c) and 2(f) of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women by Spain. The author claimed discrimination based on gender in the inheritance of noble titles. The communication was considered under the Optional Protocol to the Convention, and a decision on admissibility was adopted in 2007.

Legal Analysis and Reasoning:
The legal issues addressed in the case included discrimination based on sex in the order of succession to titles of nobility, violation of the right to equality before the law and non-discrimination on grounds of sex, and the obligation of Spain to amend or revise laws that establish male primacy in the order of succession to titles of nobility. The Court analyzed the compatibility of Spanish laws with the principle of equality and non-discrimination on the basis of sex as stated in the Spanish Constitution and the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women.

Decisions and Rulings:
The UNCEDAW Committee declared the communication inadmissible under the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women. The Committee found the communication inadmissible ratione temporis, as the facts that are the subject of the communication occurred prior to the entry into force of the Optional Protocol for Spain.

Impact and Significance:
The decision sets a precedent for cases involving discrimination based on gender in the inheritance of noble titles. It highlights the importance of exhausting domestic remedies and the temporal jurisdiction of international protocols.
