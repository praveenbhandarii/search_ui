- Document Dates: 6 June 2023
- Key Parties Involved:

  - Switzerland (the state party)
- Case Name: Tahereh Mohammdi Bandboni et al v. Switzerland
- Case Summary: Tahereh Mohammdi Bandboni, a national of the Islamic Republic of Iran, and her family claim that Switzerland has breached their rights under the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) by rejecting their asylum application and ordering their deportation, despite the risk of gender-based discrimination, death, and torture they would face in Iran.

Procedural History:
The Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women (UNCEDAW) considered the communication under article 7 (3) of the Optional Protocol to CEDAW. The authors, represented by counsel Florian Wick, submitted the communication on 8 June 2021.

Legal Analysis and Reasoning:
The legal issues addressed in the case include the violation of the authors' rights under CEDAW, specifically their right to life, liberty and security of person, freedom from torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment, and equality before the law. The authors claimed that their deportation to Iran would constitute a violation of their rights under CEDAW.

Decisions and Rulings:
The Committee found that the State party failed to properly assess the risk of serious gender-based violence in the event of the author's return to Iran. The Committee concluded that the author would face a real, personal, and foreseeable risk of gender-related persecution and honor-related violence if returned to Iran. The Committee recommended that the State party grant the author refugee status and ensure her protection against gender-based violence and discrimination.

Impact and Significance:
The decision sets a precedent for the proper assessment of the risk of gender-based violence in asylum cases. It emphasizes the importance of considering the real, personal, and foreseeable risk faced by individuals in cases of gender-related persecution and honor-related violence.

Citations and References:
The Committee's views and recommendations are based on Articles 13, 15, and 16 of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW), as well as general recommendations No. 19, No. 32, and No. 35. The decision also takes into account the State party's obligations under the Optional Protocol to CEDAW.
