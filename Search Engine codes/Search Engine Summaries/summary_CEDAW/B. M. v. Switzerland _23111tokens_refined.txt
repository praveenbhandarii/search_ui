Combined Summary:

Case Details:
- Case ID: CEDAW/C/83/D/132/2018
- Court/Tribunal: United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women (UNCEDAW)
- Document Date: 21 November 2022
- Key Parties Involved: B.M. (the author and victim) vs. Switzerland (the state party)
- Case Name: B.M. v. Switzerland

Procedural History:
The communication was submitted by B.M. to the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) on 9 August 2018. The State party contested the author's allegations, and the Committee ultimately decided that the communication was inadmissible under Article 4(2)(c) of the Optional Protocol to CEDAW.

Legal Analysis and Reasoning:
The author claimed that the application of Article 14(1) of the Vaud Cantonal Direct Taxes Act indirectly discriminates against women, violating CEDAW. The State party contested this allegation, arguing that the law is neutral and does not differentiate between men and women. The Committee based its decision on General Recommendation No. 28 (2010) on the core obligations of State parties under Article 2 of CEDAW, specifically paragraph 16, which states that the Committee shall consider communications submitted to it only if they have been sufficiently substantiated.

Decisions and Rulings:
The Committee decided that the communication was inadmissible under Article 4(2)(c) of the Optional Protocol to CEDAW because it had not been sufficiently substantiated. The Committee communicated its decision to the State party and the author.

Impact and Significance:
The decision sets a precedent for the admissibility requirements of communications submitted to the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women. It emphasizes the importance of sufficiently substantiating claims in order for them to be considered by the Committee.
