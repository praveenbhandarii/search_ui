  - State party: Finland
- Case Name: R.R. and M.R. v. Finland
- Case Summary: The authors, R.R. and M.R., Finnish nationals, submit their complaint on behalf of their deceased daughter M.M. and granddaughters K.M. and C.M., alleging violations of their rights under the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW).

Procedural History:
The authors, R.R. and M.R., submitted a communication to the Committee on 30 November 2016, on behalf of M.M., K.M., and C.M., alleging violations of the Convention. The State party objected to the admissibility of the communication, arguing that the authors lacked legal standing and that domestic remedies had not been exhausted. The Committee considered the authors' justification for acting on behalf of M.M. without her express consent and concluded that it is not precluded from considering the communication.

Legal Analysis and Reasoning:
The communication alleges violations of the Convention by the State party in relation to the death of the victims, who were killed by their father after years of gender-based violence and domestic violence. The authors argue that the State party failed to protect the victims and prevent their deaths, and they challenge the State party's omissions in preventing gender-based violence against women and protecting its victims.

Decisions and Rulings:
The Committee finds that the State party's authorities have not been given an opportunity to consider the authors' claims of indirect gender discrimination and gender-based violence, which are at the heart of the present communication to the Committee. The Committee concludes that the present communication is inadmissible under Article 4(1) of the Optional Protocol.

Impact and Significance:
The decision sets a precedent for the admissibility of communications submitted on behalf of alleged victims without their express consent, and highlights the importance of exhausting domestic remedies before bringing claims to the Committee.
