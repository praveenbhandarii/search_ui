- Document Date: 2014
- Key Parties Involved:
  - Party A: T.N. (the author and victim, represented by counsel, Tyge Trier)
  - Party B: Denmark
- Case Name: T.N. v. Denmark
- Case Summary: T.N., a citizen of the United States, alleges that she and her daughters are victims of violations by Denmark of articles 1, 2, 5, and 16 of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women. T.N. claims that her husband, a Danish national, has been physically and emotionally abusive to her and their children, and that the authorities in Denmark have failed to protect them.

Procedural History:
The communication was submitted by T.N. and her daughters, M.N. and S.N., on 19 September 2011. The Committee transmitted the communication to the State party on 23 February 2012. The State party challenged the admissibility of the communication, arguing that the author does not rely on any specific right enshrined in the Convention and does not specify the scope of her complaint.

Legal Analysis and Reasoning:
The case addresses issues of domestic violence, child custody, and visitation rights, as well as allegations of violations of Articles 1, 2, 5, and 16 of the Convention by Denmark. The author alleges discrimination based on her sex and nationality, as well as failure to protect her and her daughters from domestic violence.

Decisions and Rulings:
The Committee requested that Denmark take measures to ensure the safety and well-being of the author and her children and to properly implement the ruling of the High Court of Western Denmark regarding contact between the children and both parents. The Committee ultimately decided that the communication is inadmissible under Article 4(2)(c) of the Optional Protocol.

Impact and Significance:
The decision sets a precedent for the admissibility of communications related to domestic violence and discrimination under the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women. It highlights the importance of substantiating claims and providing comprehensive evidence in such cases.

The decision adopted by the Committee at its fifty-ninth session (20 October-7 November 2014) serves as the primary reference for the legal analysis and reasoning in this case.
