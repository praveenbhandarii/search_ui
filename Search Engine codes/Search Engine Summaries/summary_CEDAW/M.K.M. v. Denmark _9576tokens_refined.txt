- Document Date: 29 October 2018

- Case Name: M.K.M. v. Denmark
- Case Summary: M.K.M., a national of the Russian Federation, sought asylum in Denmark and her request was rejected. She claims that her deportation would amount to a violation by Denmark of articles 2 (d)(f), 5 (a) and 16 (1) (d) of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women.

Procedural History:
The author, M.K.M., sought asylum in Denmark after facing violence and discrimination in her home country. Her asylum application was rejected by the Danish Immigration Service and the Refugee Appeals Board. The case was brought before the United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women (UNCEDAW) under the Optional Protocol.

Legal Analysis and Reasoning:
The legal issues addressed in the case include the violation of rights under the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, specifically articles 2 (d)(f), 5 (a) and 16 (1) (d). The Committee analyzed the author's claims of facing gender-based violence and discrimination if deported to Russia, as well as the State party's arguments regarding the admissibility of the communication.

Decisions and Rulings:
The Committee found that the author's claims of a risk of violence by the Chechen authorities and rebels, if deported, are substantiated. The Committee requested the State party to provide information on the measures taken to protect the author from the risks of violence and discrimination she has alleged, and to ensure that her rights under the Convention are protected.

Impact and Significance:
The decision sets a precedent for the protection of individuals seeking asylum from gender-based violence and discrimination. It emphasizes the duty of States to refrain from returning a person to a jurisdiction in which they may face serious violations of human rights, as per the non-refoulement principle.

Citations and References:
The decision references general recommendations No. 32 (2014) and No. 19 of the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women, as well as the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women.
