Procedural History:
The author, M. K. D. A.A., a national of the Philippines, submitted a communication on her own behalf and on that of her son, M. A. A.A., alleging violations of their rights under the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women. The case involved family law, child custody, and domestic violence. The communication was initially submitted on 6 September 2012 and was transmitted to the State party on 19 November 2012. The case proceeded through various domestic and international legal proceedings, including applications for sole custody and termination of joint custody, as well as appeals to the District Court of Naestved and the Eastern High Court.

Legal Analysis and Reasoning:
The legal issues addressed in the case included the admissibility of the communication, alleged violations of rights under the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, and the jurisdiction of the Danish courts to hear the case. The Committee analyzed the substantive and procedural issues, including the State party's arguments regarding the admissibility of the communication under the Optional Protocol.

Decisions and Rulings:
The District Court of Naestved and the Eastern High Court ruled in favor of the author, stating that it was in the best interest of the son to live with her. The State party challenged the admissibility of the communication, citing ongoing domestic and international legal proceedings, as well as the judgment of the Eastern High Court. The Committee must decide whether the communication is admissible under the Optional Protocol.

Impact and Significance:
The case has significant implications for the interpretation and application of the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women.
