- Case Name: O.N. and D.P. v. Russian Federation
- Case Summary: The authors, O.N. and D.P., are a lesbian couple who have maintained a stable relationship for several years. They claim that the Russian Federation has violated their rights under the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women. The authors were physically assaulted and threatened with death while walking home in Saint Petersburg. They reported the incident to the police, but the investigator initially refused to open a criminal case. The decision was later overturned by the deputy prosecutor, who ordered a further inquiry into the incident. The authors have requested anonymity.

Procedural History:
- The authors, two lesbian women, were attacked and injured by a group of people in St. Petersburg, Russia.
- The authors reported the incident to the police, but the investigator refused to open a criminal case, citing lack of evidence.
- The authors complained to the supervising prosecutor, who overruled the investigator's decision and ordered further inquiry measures.
- The investigator again refused to open a criminal case, and the authors challenged this decision in court.
- The court partially accepted the authors' complaint and found that the investigator had failed to inspect the scene of the incident.
- The authors appealed the court's decision to the Saint Petersburg City Court, arguing that no effective investigation had been carried out and that the legal qualification of the crime as simple battery disregarded the homophobic motive of the perpetrators.

Legal Analysis and Reasoning:
- The authors claim a violation of Articles 1, 2(b), (c), (e), and (f) of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women.
- The State party argues that the authors and their representative did not exhaust domestic remedies and that the authors have not demonstrated a violation of the Convention.
- The State party submits that the authors have not exhausted domestic remedies, specifically the right to appeal a court decision under Article 389(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code.

Decisions and Rulings:
- The Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) found that the Russian Federation had failed to fulfill its obligations under the Convention and had violated the authors' rights.
- The Committee recommended that the Russian Federation provide appropriate remedies, including monetary compensation and psychological rehabilitation, to the authors.

Impact and Significance:
- The Committee's decision sets a precedent for holding State parties accountable for investigating and prosecuting hate crimes against individuals based on their sexual orientation.
- The decision also highlights the importance of providing effective remedies and rehabilitation to victims of discrimination and violence.
