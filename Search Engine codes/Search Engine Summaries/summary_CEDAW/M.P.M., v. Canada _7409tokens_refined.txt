- Case Name: M.P.M. v. Canada
- Case Summary: M.P.M., a Mexican national, alleges that Canada violated articles 2 (c) and (d), 3, 15, and 16 of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women by returning her to her country of origin without considering the risks she faced as a woman.

Procedural History:
The author, a Mexican national, fled to Canada with her son due to alleged threats and abuse from her former spouse. She sought refugee status in Canada, but her application was denied by the Immigration and Refugee Board. The author requested a Pre-Removal Risk Assessment (PRRA) to avoid being deported back to Mexico, but it was rejected. The author challenged the PRRA officer's decision in court, but it was upheld. The author and her son left Canada on April 1, 2010, while the State party was preparing its observations on the communication.

Legal Analysis and Reasoning:
The legal issues addressed in this case include the admissibility of the communication under Article 4, paragraphs 1 and 2, of the Optional Protocol, exhaustion of domestic remedies, the right claimed by the author, allegations of gender-based violence and abuse, credibility of the author's testimony, sufficiency of the evidence provided, and reasonableness of the PRRA officer's decision and the court's ruling.

Decisions and Rulings:
The Committee decided that the communication was inadmissible under article 4, paragraph 2 (c), of the Optional Protocol. The decision was communicated to the State party and the author.

Impact and Significance:
This case sets a precedent for the admissibility of communications under the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women. It also highlights the importance of exhausting domestic remedies and providing sufficient evidence to support claims of gender-based violence and abuse.
