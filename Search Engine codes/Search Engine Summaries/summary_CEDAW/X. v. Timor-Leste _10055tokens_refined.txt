Procedural History:
The author, Ms. X, a Timorese national, was in a relationship with a man named D.S. who was physically and emotionally abusive to her. She was convicted of murder and sentenced to 15 years in prison. She alleges that the State party failed to protect her from domestic violence and provide accessible and timely remedies. The State party ratified both the Convention and the Optional Protocol in 2003. The author is represented by counsel, Asistnsia Legl ba Feto no Labarik (Womens and Childrens Legal Aid).

Legal Analysis and Reasoning:
The legal details of the case include the violation of rights under CEDAW, the substantive issue of domestic violence, murder, imprisonment, and partial pardon. The author claims that the State party failed to protect her from domestic violence and provide accessible and timely remedies. The State party's law enforcement authorities failed to provide the author with medical care after her arrest, inform her of her rights, provide counsel at her first interview, and collect evidence that would have aided her defense.

Decisions and Rulings:
The Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) found that the State party violated the author's rights under Articles 2(c), (d), and (f) and 15 of the Convention. The Committee recommended that the State party grant the complainant a full pardon and appropriate reparation, provide mandatory training for judicial and law enforcement personnel, establish monitoring mechanisms, and conduct an exhaustive and impartial investigation into structural failures in the State party's system and practices.

Impact and Significance:
The case sets a precedent for addressing gender-based violence and discrimination in the legal system. It highlights the importance of providing timely and accessible remedies to victims of domestic violence and ensuring fair and impartial legal proceedings.
