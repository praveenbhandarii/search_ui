- Key Parties Involved:
  - Party A: K.K. (author and applicant)
  - Party B: Russian Federation (State party)
- Case Name: K.K. v. Russian Federation
- Case Summary: K.K., a Russian national and activist for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender rights, alleges a violation of her rights under articles 2 (b), (d) and (e), 5 (a) and 7 (c) of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) by the Russian Federation. She claims discriminatory treatment and harassment by a deputy of the Saint Petersburg Legislative Assembly, Vitaly Milonov, and failure of the State party to provide effective legal protection tools.

Procedural History:
The author, K.K., filed a request to initiate proceedings against Milonov with the Office of the Prosecutor of St. Petersburg and the Office of the Prosecutor of Primorsky District, which was rejected. She then pursued legal action through various courts, including the Primorsky District Court, Kirovsky District Court, and St. Petersburg City Court, all of which rejected her claims. The author also submitted a communication to the CEDAW Committee, challenging the rejection of her civil lawsuit.

Legal Analysis and Reasoning:
The case involves allegations of discrimination and harassment based on sexual orientation and gender identity, in violation of CEDAW articles 2(b), (d), and (e), 5(a), and 7(c). The author argues that the State party failed to provide effective legal remedies and recognize the violation of her rights.

Decisions and Rulings:
The State party argued that the author had not exhausted all available domestic remedies, specifically the cassation appeal to the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation. The Committee found that the cassation appeal would not constitute an effective remedy and that the State party's reference to the possibility of submitting complaints to the ombudsperson did not constitute an effective remedy. The communication was ultimately declared inadmissible under article 4(1) of the Optional Protocol.

Impact and Significance:
The case highlights the challenges faced by individuals seeking legal protection against discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity. The Committee's decision underscores the importance of effective domestic remedies in addressing such violations.
