The author claims that she has been subjected to domestic violence by her husband, V.R., and that the authorities have failed to protect her and provide her with adequate support.

Procedural History:
The Optional Protocol entered into force for the Republic of Moldova on 28 February 2006. The author, L.R., a Moldovan national, submits a communication to the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) alleging violations of Articles 1, 2, 5, and 16 of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women by the Republic of Moldova. The author is represented by Alexandru Postica of the non-governmental organization PromoLEX.

Legal Analysis and Reasoning:
The case involves allegations of domestic violence against L.R. by her former husband, V.R. The author has been seeking justice since 2010, but the case has been delayed and mishandled by the authorities. The author has filed multiple complaints and has been subjected to psychiatric evaluations, which have been inconclusive. The author's arguments and evidence have been ignored by the authorities, who have instead focused on questioning her mental health.

Decisions and Rulings:
The Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) found that the State party had violated the author's rights under the Convention. The Committee recommended that the State party take immediate and effective measures to guarantee the physical and mental integrity of the author and provide her with reparation proportionate to the harm suffered. The Committee also recommended that the State party expedite the passage of a bill to prevent and combat domestic violence and bring national legislation into full compliance with the Convention and the Convention on Preventing and Combating Violence against Women and Domestic Violence.

Impact and Significance:
The Committee's findings and recommendations have significant implications for the protection of women's rights and the prevention of domestic violence in the Republic of Moldova. The case sets a precedent for holding the State party accountable for its failures to protect victims of domestic violence and provides guidance for improving legislation and policies to address domestic violence.
