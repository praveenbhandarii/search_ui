Procedural History:

Legal Analysis and Reasoning:

- The State party argued that the application of Section 59(4) of the WAZ did not result in any discriminatory treatment of the author and does not constitute a violation of her rights under Article 11, paragraph 2(b) of CEDAW.

Decisions and Rulings:
- The Committee found that the application of Section 59(4) of the WAZ to the author's maternity leave resulted in her receiving lower benefits than she would have received if the provision had not been applied, constituting a violation of her rights under Article 11, paragraph 2(b) of the Convention.
- The Committee declared the communication admissible and found the State party in violation of the Convention.

Impact and Significance:
