- Key Parties Involved: G. D. and S. F. (authors of the communication) vs. France (State party)
- Case Name: G. D. and S. F. v. France

Procedural History:
The authors, G. D. and S. F., both French nationals, submitted a communication to the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) in 2006, alleging a violation of Article 16, paragraph 1(g) of the Convention by France. The communication was initially rejected by the State party, leading to a series of appeals and legal proceedings.

Legal Analysis and Reasoning:
The legal issues addressed in the case include sex discrimination against women in the transmission of family names, lack of recognition of mothers' family names in official documents, and limitations and obstacles in changing family names under current legislation. The relevant legal provisions include Article 16, paragraph 1(g) of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women.

Decisions and Rulings:
The Committee found that the application of the remedy provided by Article 611 of the Civil Code is unreasonably prolonged and unlikely to bring effective relief. The Committee also recommended that the State party amend its legislation on family names to conform fully to the Convention.

Impact and Significance:
The case sets a precedent for addressing gender discrimination in the transmission of family names and highlights the importance of ensuring equality between women and men in all matters relating to marriage and family relations.

Citations and References:
The case references the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, the European Parliament and Council Directives, and the Act of 4 March 2002 on family names, amended by the Act of 18 June 2003.
