Combined Summary:

Case Details:
- Case ID: CEDAW/C/76/D/141/2019
- Court/Tribunal: United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women (UNCEDAW)
- Document Date: 26 August 2020
- Key Parties Involved: M.A.M.N. (represented by counsel, Richard Timmis) vs. The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland
- Case Name: M.A.M.N. v. The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland
- Case Summary: The author, M.A.M.N., an Egyptian national born in 1976, claims that the State party has violated her rights under articles 1, 2 (f), and 9 of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women. The author's father was born outside the United Kingdom and colonies in 1944, and at that time, citizenship could not be passed down through the female line, so he was not a British subject at birth. The author applied to register as a British citizen under section 4C of the British Nationality Act 1981, but her application was refused by the Home Office.

Procedural History:
- The communication was submitted to the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women (the Committee) on 8 November 2017.
- The Committee granted the State party's request to examine the admissibility of the communication separately from its merits on 23 July 2019.

Legal Analysis and Reasoning:
- The author claims that the State party's gender-based nationality laws, which prevented her father from becoming a British subject at birth and her from becoming a British citizen by descent, constitute discrimination against women under articles 1, 2 (f), and 9 of CEDAW.
- The State party argues that the author's complaint is manifestly ill-founded and should be declared inadmissible, citing the general principle of UK nationality law and the requirement of exhaustion of domestic remedies.

Decisions and Rulings:
- The Committee declared the communication inadmissible under article 4(1) of the Optional Protocol, noting that the author had not established that the application of remedies before the courts in the State party was unreasonably prolonged or unlikely to bring effective relief.

Impact and Significance:
- The decision sets a precedent for the requirement of exhaustion of domestic remedies before bringing a case before an international forum, emphasizing the importance of allowing domestic courts to consider matters of domestic law.

Citations and References:
- The decision references the State party's arguments regarding the general principle of UK nationality law and the requirement of exhaustion of domestic remedies, as well as the Committee's decision on the admissibility of the communication.
