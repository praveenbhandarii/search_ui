- Case Name: Reyna Trujillo Reyes and Pedro Arguello Morales v. Mexico
- Case Summary: The authors of the communication, Reyna Trujillo Reyes and Pedro Arguello Morales, are Mexican nationals who are submitting the communication in respect of their deceased daughter, Pilar Arguello Trujillo, who was murdered on 3 September 2012. They claim that the State party violated articles 1, 2, 3, 5 and 15 of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women.

Procedural History:
The case involves the murder of a young woman, Pilar Arguello Trujillo, and the alleged failure of the authorities to properly investigate and prosecute the crime, resulting in impunity for the perpetrator. The authors claim that the investigation and trial were marred by irregularities and violations of their rights under the Convention, including the failure to consider evidence of sexual violence and the possibility of femicide.

Legal Analysis and Reasoning:
The authors allege that the Mexican authorities failed to act with due diligence to prevent the murder and to investigate and prosecute the perpetrator. They argue that the State party's failure to address the root causes of gender-based violence and its lack of adequate policies and procedures for investigating and prosecuting such crimes contributed to the perpetration of the crime.

Decisions and Rulings:
The Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) found the communication admissible under article 4(2)(c) of the Optional Protocol. The Committee considered that the communication raises issues under articles 1, 2, 3, 5 and 15 of the Convention and should be considered on the merits.

Impact and Significance:
The Committee made several recommendations to the state, including resuming the investigation into Pilar's murder within a reasonable timeframe, guaranteeing independent procedures for investigating, prosecuting, and punishing perpetrators of violence against women, and identifying and eliminating structural obstacles impeding the operation of the justice system in cases of gender-based violence.

Citations and References:
The case is documented under Views adopted by the Committee under article 7, paragraph 4, of the Optional Protocol, concerning communication No. 75/2014, and is part of the broader legal framework of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women.
