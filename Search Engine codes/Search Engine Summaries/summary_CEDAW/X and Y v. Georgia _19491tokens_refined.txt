Procedural History:
The case was submitted by X and Y (represented by counsel) to the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women under article 7 (3) of the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women. The case involved a complaint filed by X, a Georgian national, against the State party, Georgia, for its failure to protect her and her children from domestic violence and gender-based discrimination.

Legal Analysis and Reasoning:
The legal issues addressed in the case included the violation of articles 1, 2(b), 2(f), and 5(a) of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, lack of effective protection and remedy for victims of domestic violence in Georgia, failure of the authorities to investigate and prosecute cases of domestic violence, and societal perception of virginity as a young woman's virtue that is a guarantee of a successful marriage. The Committee's analysis focused on the State party's obligations to ensure effective protection and remedy for victims of domestic violence, eliminate discrimination against women, and provide compensation to the victims.

Decisions and Rulings:
The Committee adopted views under article 7(3) of the Optional Protocol, stating that the State party is obligated to ensure that X and Y have access to effective protection and remedy for the violations they have suffered, take all appropriate measures to eliminate discrimination against women, provide compensation to X and Y for the violations they have suffered, and ensure that similar violations do not occur in the future.

Impact and Significance:
The case sets a precedent for the State party's obligations to protect victims of domestic violence and eliminate discrimination against women. It highlights the importance of effective investigations and prosecutions to prevent further violence and protect victims of domestic violence.
