Combined Summary:

Case Details:
- Case ID: CEDAW/C/55/D/40/2012
- Court/Tribunal: United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women (UNCEDAW)
- Document Dates: Decision adopted by the Committee at its fifty-fifth session, 22 July 2013
- Key Parties Involved:
  - Party A: M. S. (represented by counsel, Helge Nrrung)
  - Party B: Denmark
- Case Name: M. S. v. Denmark
- Case Summary: M. S., a Pakistani Christian woman, submitted a communication to the UNCEDAW claiming that her and her family's deportation to Pakistan would constitute a violation of their rights under the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, read in conjunction with the Committee's general recommendation No. 19.

Procedural History:
- The Optional Protocol to the Convention entered into force for Denmark on 22 December 2000.
- The Working Group on Communications, acting on behalf of the Committee, granted interim measures requesting Denmark to refrain from expelling M. S. and her family to Pakistan while their communication was under consideration by the Committee.
- The Committee considered the admissibility of the communication separately from its merits.
- The Committee found that the author's communication was admissible, pursuant to article 5(1) of the Optional Protocol and rule 63 of the Committee's rules of procedure.

Legal Analysis and Reasoning:
- The author invoked articles 1, 2, 3, 5, and 16 of the Convention, as well as General Recommendation No. 19, claiming that her deportation to Pakistan would violate her rights under the Convention.
- The State party argued that the communication should be declared inadmissible due to lack of exhaustion of domestic remedies, extraterritorial application of the Convention, and incompatibility with the provisions of the Convention.

Decisions and Rulings:
- The Committee declared the communication inadmissible under Article 4(2)(c) of the Optional Protocol, as the author failed to sufficiently substantiate her claim that her removal to Pakistan would expose her to a real, personal, and foreseeable risk of serious forms of gender-based violence.
- The Committee decided not to examine the remaining inadmissibility grounds invoked by the State party, in light of its conclusion that the communication was inadmissible under Article 4(2)(c) of the Optional Protocol.

Impact and Significance:
- The decision sets a precedent for the admissibility criteria under the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women.
- It clarifies the standard of proof required for demonstrating a real, personal, and foreseeable risk of serious forms of gender-based violence in the context of deportation.
