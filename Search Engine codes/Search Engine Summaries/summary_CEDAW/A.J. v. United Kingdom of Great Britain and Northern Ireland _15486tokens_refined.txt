- Case Name: A.J. et al. v. United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland
- Case Summary: The authors, seven women, claimed that the State party had violated their rights under various articles of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women. The claims arose from the actions of undercover police officers who had deceived the women into entering into long-term intimate relationships with them.

Procedural History:
The authors, represented by counsel, submitted the communication to the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) in 2017. The State party disputed the admissibility of the claim, arguing that the women failed to exhaust domestic remedies and did not adequately raise the issue of discrimination in their national claims. The authors settled their civil claims and received substantial compensation and payment for legal costs. The State party initiated an Undercover Policing Inquiry to investigate the use of undercover police officers, which is ongoing.

Legal Analysis and Reasoning:
The authors alleged violations of their rights under various articles of the Convention, including gender-based discrimination, deceit, and violation of their reproductive rights. They argued that the State party failed to provide effective remedies and guarantees of non-repetition. The State party disputed the admissibility of the claim, citing the settlement agreements and ongoing inquiry as relevant domestic remedies.

Decisions and Rulings:
The Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) found the communication admissible under the Optional Protocol. The Committee determined that the ongoing Undercover Policing Inquiry did not constitute an obstacle to the admissibility of the communication, as it was unreasonably prolonged. The Committee also found that the authors' settlement agreements with the government did not bar their victim status, as they did not provide full reparation for the harm suffered and did not include guarantees of non-repetition. The Committee decided to consider the merits of the communication.

Impact and Significance:
The decision of the Committee to consider the merits of the communication sets a precedent for cases involving violations of women's rights by undercover police officers. It highlights the importance of effective remedies and guarantees of non-repetition in addressing such violations.
