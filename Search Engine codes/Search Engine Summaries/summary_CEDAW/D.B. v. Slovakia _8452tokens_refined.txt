- Key Parties Involved: D.B. (represented by counsel, Vanda Durbkov) vs. Slovakia
- Case Name: D.B. v. Slovakia
- Case Summary: D.B., a national of Slovakia, alleges that Slovakia has violated her rights under article 2 (c) and (e), read in conjunction with articles 1 and 16 (1) (h), of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW), by failing to protect her from gender-based discrimination in divorce proceedings and the division of joint marital property.

Procedural History:
The communication was submitted by D.B. (represented by counsel, Vanda Durbkov) on December 4, 2017. The decision was adopted by the Committee on July 6, 2020, under article 4 (2) (c) of the Optional Protocol. The jurisdiction and competence lie with the United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women (UNCEDAW).

Legal Analysis and Reasoning:
The legal issues addressed in this case include gender-based discrimination in divorce proceedings and the division of joint marital property. The relevant legal provisions are article 2 (c) and (e), in conjunction with articles 1 and 16 (1) (h) of CEDAW. The Court's analysis focused on the lack of substantiation as a procedural issue and the substantive issue of gender-based discrimination in the division of marital property.

Decisions and Rulings:
The District Court of Koice I initially pronounced the divorce and made a decision on the division of marital property, allocating 65% to the author and 35% to her former spouse. The Regional Court of Koice rejected the author's appeal, and the Constitutional Court dismissed her appeal. The Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW Committee) found the communication admissible and proceeded to consider its merits.

Impact and Significance:
This case sets a precedent for addressing gender-based discrimination in divorce proceedings and the division of marital property. It highlights the importance of considering the specific circumstances of women who have experienced spousal violence and the economic consequences of such violence in property division.
