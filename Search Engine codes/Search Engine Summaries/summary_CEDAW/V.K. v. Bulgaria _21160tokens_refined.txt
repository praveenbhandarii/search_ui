- Case Summary: Ms. V.K., a Bulgarian citizen, alleges violations by the State party of articles 1, 2, 5 and 16 of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women.

Procedural History:
- The author, Ms. V.K., filed a complaint against Bulgaria for failing to protect her from domestic violence.
- The Plovdiv District Court and Plovdiv Regional Court rejected her application for a permanent protection order, leading to the complaint being brought before the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW).

Legal Analysis and Reasoning:
- The Committee found that the State party had violated the author's rights under the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women by failing to provide effective protection against domestic violence.
- The Committee also noted that the courts' decisions were based on stereotyped and discriminatory notions of domestic violence, and that the State party's legal and institutional framework was inadequate for protecting victims of domestic violence.

Decisions and Rulings:
- The Committee recommended that the State party provide the author with adequate compensation and take measures to protect women from domestic violence, including amending its legislation and implementing effective policies and programs.

Impact and Significance:
- The Committee's findings and recommendations have significant implications for the protection of women from domestic violence in Bulgaria and may set a precedent for similar cases in other countries.
