Case Details:
- Case ID: CEDAW/C/84/D/123/2017
- Court/Tribunal: United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women (UNCEDAW)
- Document Dates: 2023
- Key Parties Involved:
  - Party A: J.M. (represented by the National Council of Single Mothers and their Children Incorporated)
  - Party B: Australia
- Case Name: J.M. v. Australia

Procedural History:
The author, J.M., an Australian citizen, claims that the State party has violated her rights under articles 2 (d) and (f), 11 (e) and 13 (a) of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women. The author is represented by counsel. The communication was transmitted to the State party (Australia) on 17 January 2018, and the CEDAW Committee adopted its views on 23 February 2023.

Legal Analysis and Reasoning:
The case concerns J.M.'s situation as a single mother who was forced to stop working due to the lack of affordable childcare, leading her to rely on the Parenting Payment Single. The Government's Welfare to Work reforms in 2005 and subsequent amendments lowered the eligibility cutoff age for the children of parents eligible to receive the Parenting Payment Single, affecting J.M.'s entitlement to the payment. The author argues that the changes violated her human rights, particularly the right to social security and the right to an adequate standard of living.

Decisions and Rulings:
The State party argues that the removal of transitional arrangements for the Parenting Payment Single does not discriminate against single parents or women. The State party emphasizes that eligibility for the Parenting Payment will continue until a recipient's youngest child reaches school age, and principal carer parents who wish to continue to receive income support are required to meet part-time participation requirements.

Impact and Significance:
The case highlights the ongoing debate surrounding the impact of social security reforms on single mothers and their access to adequate support. It also raises important questions about the intersection of gender-based discrimination and social security policies.

Citations and References:
The case references the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) and the State party's legislative amendments related to social security and employment.
