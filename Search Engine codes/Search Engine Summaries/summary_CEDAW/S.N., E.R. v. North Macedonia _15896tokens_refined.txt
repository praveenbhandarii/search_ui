- Case Name: S.N. and E.R. v. North Macedonia
- Case Summary: The authors, two Roma women from North Macedonia, alleged that they were victims of a violation of their rights under the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women due to the failure of the State party to take all appropriate positive measures to protect their right to health, including their right to maternity care, their right to adequate living conditions, and their right to be free from discrimination.

Procedural History:
The Optional Protocol entered into force for the State party on 17 January 2004. The Committee, acting through its Working Group on Communications under the Optional Protocol, requested the State party to provide suitable emergency accommodation, nutrition, clean water, and immediate access to health care services, including maternal healthcare services, pursuant to article 5 (1) of the Optional Protocol and rule 63 of the rules of procedure of the Committee.

Legal Analysis and Reasoning:
The authors claimed violation of their rights under the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, specifically citing articles 2 (d) and (f), article 4 (1) and (2), article 12 (1) and (2), and article 14 (2) (b) and (h) of the Convention. They argued that the State party failed to take all appropriate measures to respect, protect, and fulfill their right to health, including maternal care, their right to adequate living conditions, and their right to be free from discrimination.

Decisions and Rulings:
The Committee found that the State party violated the women's rights under the Convention by failing to provide them with adequate protection against discrimination and by denying them access to necessary healthcare services. The Committee recommended that the State party take immediate measures to provide the women with alternative housing and access to reproductive healthcare services.

Impact and Significance:
The case sets a precedent for the protection of the rights of marginalized communities, particularly Roma women, and highlights the importance of access to justice for victims of discrimination. It also emphasizes the need for States to adopt and implement policies and programs to combat discrimination against Roma women and girls.
