- Case Summary: S.J.A., a Somali national, sought asylum in Denmark to escape a forced marriage to a member of Al-Shabaab. Her asylum application was rejected, and she was ordered to leave Denmark.

Procedural History:
The communication was submitted by S.J.A. (represented by counsel, Tage Gttsche) on 2 December 2014. The Committee adopted a decision on 6 November 2017, under article 4 (2) (c) of the Optional Protocol, concerning communication No. 79/2014.

Legal Analysis and Reasoning:
The main issues addressed in the case were the author's credibility and the veracity of her claims, the risk of gender-based violence and forced marriage in Somalia, the adequacy of the assessment made by the Refugee Appeals Board, and the State party's obligation to protect the author from a real, personal, and foreseeable risk of persecution. The relevant legal provisions were articles 3, 5, and 16 (b) of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women.

Decisions and Rulings:
The Committee found that the author's claims of a risk of gender-based violence in Somalia were not credible and substantiated. It concluded that the author's rights under the Convention had not been violated by the Danish authorities' decision to reject her asylum application. The communication was deemed inadmissible under article 4 (2) (c) of the Optional Protocol.

Impact and Significance:
The case sets a precedent for the assessment of asylum claims based on the risk of gender-based violence in the home country. It highlights the importance of substantiating claims and credibility in asylum applications.
