- Document Date: 24 October 2022
- Key Parties Involved: Sandra Luz Romn Jaimes (represented by counsel, Idheas, Litigio Estratgico en Derechos Humanos) and the State party (Mexico)
- Case Name: Sandra Luz Romn Jaimes v. Mexico
- Case Summary: Sandra Luz Romn Jaimes alleges that her daughter, Ivette Melissa Flores Romn, was subjected to continuous ill-treatment, including physical and psychological abuse, and was eventually disappeared. The author claims that the State party has violated her daughter's rights under articles 1, 2 (b) (f), 5 (a), and 15 (1) of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women.

Procedural History:
The Optional Protocol entered into force for the State party on 15 March 2002. The author and her family members have pursued all possible domestic remedies to search for her daughter and ensure that those responsible for her detention and disappearance are investigated, tried, and punished.

Legal Analysis and Reasoning:
The case involves the disappearance of a woman's daughter in Iguala, Mexico, and the alleged failure of the State party to properly investigate and prevent her disappearance. The author alleges that the State party violated her daughter's rights under the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women by failing to properly investigate her daughter's disappearance and for not considering the context of gender-based violence in Iguala.

Decisions and Rulings:
The Committee concludes that the State party's authorities failed to effectively investigate and prosecute those responsible for the enforced disappearance of Ms. Flores Romn, and that the investigation did not incorporate a gender perspective. The Committee recommends that the State party continue the investigation with a gender perspective and ensure that all entities responsible for searching for women victims of enforced disappearances conduct their work with a gender perspective.

Impact and Significance:
The Committee's findings have significant implications for the investigation and prosecution of cases involving gender-based violence and enforced disappearances. The recommendations set a precedent for the incorporation of a gender perspective in investigations and the need for comprehensive reparation for victims and their families.

Citations and References:
The Committee's findings are based on the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, general recommendations No. 19, No. 28, No. 33, and No. 35, as well as relevant domestic laws and protocols related to the investigation and search for missing persons. The case also references various amparo judgments and the actions taken by the State party in response to the disappearance.
