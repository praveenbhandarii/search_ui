Case Name: M.D.C.P. v. Spain

Procedural History:
The author, M.D.C.P., a Spanish national, alleges that Spain violated her rights under the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women owing to the obstetric violence she experienced in hospital during childbirth. The case was submitted to the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) under communication No. 154/2020. The communication was submitted on 10 November 2018, and the views were adopted by the Committee on 24 February 2023.

Legal Analysis and Reasoning:
The legal issues addressed in the case include violations of Articles 2, 3, 4, 5, 12, and 24 of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women. The author alleges obstetric violence, discrimination against women, and violations of reproductive rights and healthcare. The Court analyzed the evidence presented by the author and the State party to determine the violations of the Convention.

Decisions and Rulings:
The Committee found that the State party violated the author's rights under the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women. The State party failed to provide adequate medical care, obtain informed consent, and protect the author from obstetric violence. The Committee recommended full reparation for the author, including financial compensation for the physical and psychological harm suffered. The State party was also urged to ensure access to adequate healthcare services during pregnancy, childbirth, and the postpartum period, and to protect women from mistreatment, disrespect, and abuse during childbirth in healthcare institutions.

Impact and Significance:
The case sets a precedent for addressing obstetric violence and discrimination against women in healthcare settings. It highlights the importance of informed consent, access to safe and high-quality maternity services, and the need to combat gender stereotypes and gender-based violence. The recommendations have broader legal implications for promoting women's rights to reproductive health and ensuring accountability for violations of these rights.
