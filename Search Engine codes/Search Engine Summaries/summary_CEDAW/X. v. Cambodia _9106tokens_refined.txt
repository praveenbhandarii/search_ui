Case Summary: The author, a Cambodian national, submits a communication to the UNCEDAW claiming that the State party has breached her rights under the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) in relation to a land dispute with a development company.

Procedural History:
The United Nations Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) Committee considered a communication (No. 146/2019) submitted by X. (represented by A.), a Cambodian national, against the State party (Cambodia).

Legal Analysis and Reasoning:
The Committee found that the State party had breached the author's rights under articles 2(c) and (e) and 3 of the Convention by failing to protect her from violence and discrimination by KDC International. The State party also failed to take appropriate measures to ensure the author's participation in the elaboration and implementation of KDC International's project, violating articles 14(1) and (2)(a), (g) and (h) of the Convention. Additionally, the State party violated the author's rights under article 15(1) by failing to provide adequate compensation following sufficient consultative processes.

Decisions and Rulings:
The Committee concluded that the State party had violated the author's rights under the Convention and recommended that the State party take immediate steps to provide the author with adequate compensation and to ensure that she is able to return to her land and home in safety and dignity. The Committee also recommended that the State party take all necessary measures to prevent similar violations in the future.

Impact and Significance:
The Committee's decision sets a precedent for holding state parties accountable for failing to protect women's rights in land disputes and development projects. It also emphasizes the importance of providing adequate compensation and ensuring the safety and dignity of individuals affected by such violations.
