Procedural History:
The author, O.G., a national of the Russian Federation, submits a communication to the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) alleging violations of her rights under the Convention by the Russian Federation.

The author alleges violations of articles 1, 2(b)(g), read in conjunction with the Committee's general recommendations No. 19 and No. 28, and articles 3 and 5(a) of the Convention. The author claims that the State party has violated her rights under the Convention by failing to implement contemporary and comprehensive legislation on domestic violence, and by not responding adequately to her complaints.

Decisions and Rulings:
The Committee finds that the State party's failure to investigate and prosecute the author's former partner for domestic violence and its failure to modify or abolish customs and practices that constitute discrimination against women violated the author's rights under articles 1, 2(b), (g), 3, and 5(a) of the Convention.

Impact and Significance:
The Committee's decision sets a precedent for holding State parties accountable for failing to address domestic violence and gender-based discrimination.
