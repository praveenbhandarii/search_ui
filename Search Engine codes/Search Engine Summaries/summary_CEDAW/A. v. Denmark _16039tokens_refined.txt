Case Details:
- Case ID: CEDAW/C/62/D/53/2013
- Court/Tribunal: United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women (UNCEDAW)
- Document Dates: 2015
- Key Parties Involved:
  - Alleged victim: A. (represented by counsel, Niels-Erik Hansen)
  - State party: Denmark
- Case Name: A. v. Denmark
- Case Summary: The author, A., a Pakistani national, claims to be a victim of a violation by Denmark of her rights under articles 1, 2 (c) and (d), 3, 12, 15 and 16 of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women. The author alleges that she was subjected to physical and sexual violence by her husband and his family, and that the Danish authorities failed to protect her from this abuse.

Procedural History:
The author, A., represented by counsel, Niels-Erik Hansen, filed a communication against Denmark under the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women. The State party, Denmark, submitted observations on the admissibility of the communication, contesting the author's claims and arguing that the communication should be declared inadmissible.

Legal Analysis and Reasoning:
The legal issues addressed in the case include the admissibility and merits of the communication, the violation of rights under the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, and the extraterritorial effect of the Convention. The Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women analyzed the author's claims in light of the relevant legal provisions and the State party's arguments.

Decisions and Rulings:
The Committee found that the author's rights under the Convention had been violated by Denmark. It recommended that Denmark grant the author a residence permit and provide her with adequate protection against violence and discrimination. The Committee also held that the State party's arguments regarding the extraterritorial effect of the Convention were not valid.

Impact and Significance:
The case sets a precedent for the extraterritorial effect of human rights treaties and the responsibility of State parties for protecting individuals from human rights violations in other countries. It highlights the importance of providing adequate protection to victims of gender-based violence and the obligation of States to refrain from returning individuals to jurisdictions where they may face serious violations of human rights.
