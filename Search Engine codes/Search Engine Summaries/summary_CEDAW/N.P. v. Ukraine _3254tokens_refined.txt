Case Details:
- Case ID: CEDAW/C/68/D/95/2015
- Court/Tribunal: United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women (UNCEDAW)
- Document Dates: 2017
- Key Parties Involved:
  - Party A: N.P. (the author and victim)
  - Party B: Ukraine
- Case Name: N.P. v. Ukraine
- Case Summary: N.P., a Ukrainian national, claimed that Ukraine violated her rights under the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women due to her dismissal from her job at a public hospital, unequal treatment in national courts, and failure by the State party to protect her rights.

Procedural History:
- Date of communication: 24 June 2015 (initial submission)
- The Optional Protocol entered into force for Ukraine on 26 December 2003.
- N.P. was not represented by counsel.

Legal Analysis and Reasoning:
- Legal Issues Addressed: Discrimination against women in employment and education
- Relevant Legal Provisions: Articles 2 (c), (d) and (e), 11 (1) (a), 15 (2) and 24 of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women
- Court's Analysis: The alleged violations took place before the entry into force for Ukraine of the Optional Protocol, which cannot be applied retroactively.

Decisions and Rulings:
- The CEDAW Committee declared the communication inadmissible as it was submitted after the Optional Protocol to the Convention had already entered into force for Ukraine, and the author failed to demonstrate any exceptional grounds that would justify reopening the proceedings in her case.

Impact and Significance:
- The decision sets a precedent regarding the application of the Optional Protocol retroactively and the need for exceptional grounds to reopen proceedings.
