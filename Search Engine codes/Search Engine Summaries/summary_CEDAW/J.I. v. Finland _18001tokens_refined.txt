- Case Name: J.I. and E.A. v. Finland
- Case Summary: J.I. and E.A. submitted a communication to the UNCEDAW alleging that Finland had violated their rights under the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women by failing to protect them from domestic violence and by removing their child from their custody without proper investigation and due process.

Procedural History:
The author, J.I., a Finnish national, submitted a communication to the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) on behalf of herself and her son, E.A. The communication concerns violence and discrimination against the author by her former partner, J.A., including physical and emotional abuse, and attempts to force her to have an abortion. The case involves a custody dispute between the mother and father, with the mother seeking custody of her son, E.A., and the father seeking visitation rights.

Legal Analysis and Reasoning:
The author alleges that the State party has failed to adopt adequate legislative and policy measures to guarantee her rights and those of her son, particularly in relation to custody, residence, and visitation rights. The author claims that the State party's failure to protect her and her son from gender-based violence and discrimination has resulted in unequal treatment and a lack of protection for mothers and victims of domestic violence.

Decisions and Rulings:
The UNCEDAW adopted views on the communication, finding that Finland had violated the authors' rights under the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women. The Committee expressed concern over the failure of the State party to protect the rights of the author and her son under the Convention, particularly in relation to the custody proceedings.

Impact and Significance:
The Committee made several recommendations to Finland, including reopening judicial proceedings concerning the custody of the child, granting the mother appropriate reparation, and conducting an exhaustive and impartial investigation to determine whether there were structural failures in the State party's system and practices that may cause victims of domestic violence to be deprived of protection.

Citations and References:
The Committee's decision is based on the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women and its general recommendations, as well as the State party's legislation and practices regarding domestic violence and custody proceedings. The Committee's views and recommendations are to be widely disseminated in order to reach all relevant sectors of society.
