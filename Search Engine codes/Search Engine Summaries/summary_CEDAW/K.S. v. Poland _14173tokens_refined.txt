Procedural History:
The author, K.S., a Polish national, alleged that Poland violated her rights under the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) by failing to protect her from domestic violence. The case was brought before the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women, with the initial submission made on 11 April 2017.

Legal Analysis and Reasoning:
The legal issues addressed in the case included the State party's failure to protect the author from domestic violence, the lack of effective remedies for the harm suffered, and the impact of domestic violence on women's rights. The relevant legal provisions were articles 2 (a), (c)(f), 3, 5 (a) and 16 of CEDAW. The Court's analysis focused on the State party's obligations under the Convention and the author's efforts to seek help from the authorities.

Decisions and Rulings:
The Committee ruled in favor of the author, finding that Poland had violated her rights under the Convention by failing to protect her from domestic violence and by not providing her with effective remedies for the harm suffered. The Committee's decision was based on the State party's failure to act with due diligence to protect the author from domestic violence.

Impact and Significance:
The case sets a precedent for the protection of women from domestic violence and highlights the importance of effective remedies for victims. It also emphasizes the State party's obligations under the Convention to address domestic violence and protect women's rights.
