Case Details:
- Case ID: CEDAW/C/69/D/85/2015
- Court/Tribunal: United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women (UNCEDAW)
- Document Dates: 25 April 2018
- Key Parties Involved:
  - Party A: S.F.A. (the author and victim)
  - Party B: Denmark (the state party)
- Case Name: S.F.A. v. Denmark

Procedural History:
The case involves S.F.A., a Somali national, seeking asylum in Denmark, which was rejected, leading to her and her son facing deportation to Somalia. S.F.A. claimed that her deportation would constitute a violation by Denmark of articles 1, 2 (d), 12, 15 and 16 of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women. The communication was submitted on 22 April 2015, and the decision was adopted on 25 April 2018.

Legal Analysis and Reasoning:
The legal issues addressed in the case include the violation of rights under the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, particularly in relation to asylum, deportation, female genital mutilation, and forced marriage. The Committee analyzed the substantive and procedural issues, considering the request for interim measures and the alleged violations of the Convention.

Decisions and Rulings:
The Committee requested the State party to refrain from expelling S.F.A. and her son to Somalia while the communication was under consideration. The State party's requests to lift the interim measures were denied. The Committee ultimately found the communication inadmissible under article 4 (2) (c) of the Optional Protocol.

Impact and Significance:
The case sets a precedent for the consideration of gender-based violence and discrimination in asylum applications and deportation decisions. It highlights the importance of assessing the specific circumstances of each asylum seeker, particularly in relation to the risk of gender-based violence.

Citations and References:
The decision is based on the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, as well as relevant general recommendations and case law from international human rights bodies. The case also references the State party's observations and the Board of Appeal's decision in Denmark.
