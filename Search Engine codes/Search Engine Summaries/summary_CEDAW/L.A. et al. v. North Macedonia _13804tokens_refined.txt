Procedural History:
The authors, represented by the European Roma Rights Centre, submitted the communication on 21 December 2016. The State party provided observations on admissibility and merits, and the authors responded to the State party's observations. The Committee found the communication admissible and proceeded to consider its merits.

Legal Analysis and Reasoning:
The Committee found that the State party violated the rights of the Roma women and girls under Articles 2 (d) and (f), 12 (1) and (2), and 14 (2) (b) and (h) of the Convention. The State party failed to provide suitable emergency accommodation, nutrition, clean water, and immediate access to healthcare services, despite the Committee's request. The Committee also noted the lack of effective domestic remedies against the eviction.

Decisions and Rulings:
The Committee recommended that the State party take immediate measures to address the discrimination faced by the Roma women and ensure their access to adequate healthcare, including reproductive healthcare. The State party was given six months to respond to the Committee's views and recommendations.

Impact and Significance:
The Committee's decision sets a precedent for addressing discrimination against Roma women and the importance of providing access to adequate housing and healthcare. It highlights the need for effective domestic remedies and the State party's obligation to protect the rights of marginalized communities.
