- Case Summary: V.P., a Belarusian national, claimed that the State party violated her rights under the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women by denying her an old-age pension due to her lack of pensionable service.

Procedural History:
The communication was submitted by V.P. (represented by the Belarusian Helsinki Committee) to the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women on 20 November 2017. The views were adopted by the Committee on 28 June 2021.

Legal Analysis and Reasoning:
The legal issues addressed in the case include exhaustion of domestic remedies, discrimination against women, social security rights, and gender-based discrimination affecting access to a retirement pension. The relevant legal provisions are Article 2 (b) (d) and (f) and Article 11 (1) (e) of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women. The Court analyzed the impact of caretaking responsibilities on women's ability to accumulate pensionable service and the State party's argument that the pension system is designed to achieve de facto equality.

Decisions and Rulings:
The Committee declared the communication admissible and proceeded to consider the merits. It found that the State party's changes to the legal framework and requirements for the old-age pension did not constitute a breach of the Convention. The Committee rejected the author's claim under Article 7(3) of the Optional Protocol.

Impact and Significance:
The case sets a precedent for the interpretation of gender-based discrimination in access to retirement pensions. It highlights the importance of considering the impact of caretaking responsibilities on women's ability to meet pensionable service requirements.
