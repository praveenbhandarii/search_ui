- Case Name: S.O. v. Canada
- Case Summary: S.O., a Mexican national, sought asylum in Canada due to domestic violence. Her application was rejected, and she was awaiting deportation. She claimed that deportation would constitute a violation of Articles 1-3 of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women.

Procedural History:
The author, a Mexican national, fled to Canada due to domestic violence and sought refugee protection. Her application was denied, and she was ordered to be removed from Canada. The author applied for leave to seek judicial review of the decision, which was denied. The State party submitted its observations on the admissibility of the communication, challenging the admissibility on three grounds.

Legal Analysis and Reasoning:
The legal issues addressed in this case include the admissibility of the communication, the obligation of non-refoulement, and the violation of Articles 1-3 of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women. The Committee analyzed the exhaustion of domestic remedies, the interpretation of the Convention, and the evidence presented by both parties.

Decisions and Rulings:
The Committee found that S.O.'s rights under the Convention had been violated and requested Canada to take measures to protect her from deportation. However, the Committee also decided that the communication was inadmissible under Article 4(2)(c) of the Optional Protocol.

Impact and Significance:
This case sets a precedent for the interpretation of the obligation of non-refoulement under the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women. It also highlights the challenges faced by individuals seeking asylum due to gender-based violence.
