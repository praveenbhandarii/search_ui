- Case Name: V. v. Denmark

Procedural History:
- Registered on 13 August 2013, pursuant to Article 5(1) of the OP-CEDAW and Rule 63 of the Committee's rules of procedure
- Committee requested Denmark not to deport the author pending examination of her case
- State party informed the Committee that it had stayed her deportation and requested the Committee to first examine the admissibility of the communication
- Committee decided to examine the admissibility together with the merits of the communication on 8 January 2014

Legal Analysis and Reasoning:
- The author, a Christian woman from India, is seeking asylum in Denmark due to fear of persecution in her home country.
- The author claims that her relationship with a Hindu man, R., has led to conflicts with her family and his, and that she fears honor-related violence or killing if she returns to India.
- The Danish authorities have denied her request for asylum and have ordered her deportation to India.
- The author has filed a complaint with the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) claiming that her deportation would constitute a violation of her rights under the Convention.

Decisions and Rulings:
- The State party argues that the communication should be declared inadmissible as manifestly ill-founded and unsubstantiated, and incompatible with the provisions of the Convention.
- The Committee declares the communication inadmissible under article 4(2)(c) of the Optional Protocol.

Impact and Significance:
- The decision sets a precedent for the assessment of asylum claims based on gender-based violence and persecution.
- It highlights the importance of providing sufficient evidence to support claims of persecution and the rigorous assessment required to establish a real risk of treatment contrary to the Convention.
