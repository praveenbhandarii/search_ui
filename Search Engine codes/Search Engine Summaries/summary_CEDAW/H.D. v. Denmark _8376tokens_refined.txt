- Case Name: H.D. v. Denmark
- Case Summary: H.D., a Somali national, claimed that her deportation to Somalia would violate her rights under articles 2, 12, and 15 of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women.

Procedural History:
The author, a Somali national, fled to Denmark in May 2014 and sought asylum, citing fear of persecution from her husband's family and Al-Shabaab. Her asylum application was rejected by the Danish Immigration Service and later confirmed by the Refugee Appeals Board. The author filed a complaint against Denmark for violating her rights under the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) by denying her asylum application.

Legal Analysis and Reasoning:
The legal issues addressed in this case include the violation of the author's rights under the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, particularly in relation to gender-based violence. The Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) considered the claims made by the author and the State party's arguments. The Committee found that the author's account lacked credibility due to factual inconsistencies and a lack of substantiation.

Decisions and Rulings:
The communication was deemed inadmissible under Article 4(2)(c) of the Optional Protocol. The Committee concluded that the author had failed to establish a real, personal, and foreseeable risk of serious gender-based violence if deported to Somalia.

Impact and Significance:
This decision sets a precedent for future cases involving claims of gender-based violence and asylum applications. It emphasizes the importance of substantiating claims and establishing a real, personal, and foreseeable risk of harm in such cases.
