Procedural History:
- The author, a national of Afghanistan, filed a communication with the Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, alleging that his deportation to Afghanistan would violate his rights under the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD).
- The Committee adopted a decision in March 2019, addressing the admissibility and merits of the author's claims.

Legal Analysis and Reasoning:
- The author, a citizen of Afghanistan residing in Sweden since 2012, claimed that his removal to Afghanistan would violate his rights under the CRPD.
- The author alleged that he suffered from posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and suicidal thoughts, and that the Swedish authorities had inadequately assessed his health status.
- The Committee found that the author had failed to provide sufficient reasons to challenge the domestic assessment of his health status, rendering his communication inadmissible under article 2(e) of the Optional Protocol to the CRPD.
- The Committee referred to its jurisprudence in O.O.J. et al. v. Sweden and N.L. v. Sweden, which established that the removal of an individual to a jurisdiction where they would risk facing violations of the Convention could engage the responsibility of the removing State under the Convention.
- The Committee emphasized the principle of non-refoulement, which imposes a duty on a State party to refrain from removing a person from its territory when there is a real risk that the person would be subjected to serious violations of Convention rights amounting to a risk of irreparable harm.

Decisions and Rulings:
- The Committee ruled that the author's communication was inadmissible under article 2(e) of the Optional Protocol to the CRPD due to the lack of sufficient reasons provided to challenge the domestic assessment.
- The Committee highlighted the importance of providing sufficient evidence to support claims of violations of Convention rights when challenging a domestic assessment.

Impact and Significance:
- The decision has implications for the author's ability to seek protection against removal to Afghanistan under the CRPD.
- The decision underscores the importance of providing sufficient evidence to support claims of violations of Convention rights when challenging a domestic assessment.
- The case highlights the need for individuals to demonstrate a real risk of irreparable harm if removed to a jurisdiction where they would face violations of the Convention.
