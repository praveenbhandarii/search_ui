Summary:

Case Details:
This case, titled S.M. v. Denmark, was brought before the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. The case ID is 61/2019, and it involves allegations of violations of the author's rights under the Convention. The key parties involved are S.M. (the author) and Denmark (the State party). The case revolves around the author's claim that Denmark violated his rights by subjecting him to forced psychiatric interventions and indefinite forced medication. The author is a refugee who has been subjected to gender-based violence and has been sentenced to forced psychiatric treatment in a closed facility in preparation for the trial.

Procedural History:
The initial submission of the case was made on September 12, 2017. On July 3, 2019, the document was not issued in document form. Finally, on August 25, 2023, the Committee adopted its views on the case. The jurisdiction for this case lies with the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. The author emailed a member of the delegation of the State party who participated in the constructive dialogue with the Committee during the consideration of the State party's initial report, but that member failed to raise the breaches of the Convention in court. The presiding judge of the District Court stated that it was not the responsibility of the author's lawyer to determine whether coercive psychiatric treatment was contrary to the Convention, in violation of the presumption of innocence. The author was given only 10 minutes to make a statement and was not afforded an opportunity to defend himself in writing. The author argues that the North Zealand police did not want to conduct a criminal investigation into the psychiatrists' actions. The author was sentenced to psychiatric treatment because of the declaration of nonresponsibility.

Legal Analysis and Reasoning:
The Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities analyzed the author's allegations and found that Denmark had violated the author's rights under various articles of the Convention. Specifically, the Committee determined that the State party had violated articles 14, 15, and 16, read in conjunction with article 4, as well as articles 17 and 25. The Committee also noted that the author had been subjected to indefinite forced medication, which is a violation of article 17. Additionally, the Committee found that the author's right to a fair trial had been violated due to the lack of an opportunity to respond to the charges in writing. The author's claims under articles 15 and 16, read in conjunction with article 4, of the Convention do not contain sufficient elements to enable the Committee to assess to what extent the forced psychiatric treatment of the author breached his rights under the Convention. The author's claim of his detention from 15 December 2014 until 24 February 2015 being based on his disability is insufficiently substantiated under article 2 (e) of the Optional Protocol. The Committee considers that the author's claims regarding the alleged failure of the police to conduct a criminal investigation into forced psychiatric treatment are manifestly ill-founded.

Decisions and Rulings:
The Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities adopted its views on August 25, 2023. The Committee concluded that Denmark had violated the author's rights under the Convention. The key findings include the violations of articles 14, 15, and 16, read in conjunction with article 4, as well as articles 17 and 25. The Committee also highlighted the violation of the author's right to a fair trial.

Impact and Significance:
This case highlights the importance of protecting the rights of individuals with disabilities, particularly in relation to forced psychiatric interventions and medication. The Committee's decision sets a precedent for future cases involving similar violations of the Convention. It emphasizes the need for States parties to ensure that their legislation and policies align with the Convention and that individuals are not subjected to discrimination or unequal treatment based on their disability status. The case also underscores the need for adequate legal representation and the importance of considering the Convention's provisions when sentencing individuals with disabilities.
