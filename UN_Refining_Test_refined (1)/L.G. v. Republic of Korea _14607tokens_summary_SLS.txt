Combined Summary:

Case Details:
The case of L.G. v. Republic of Korea involves a petition filed by L.G., a national of New Zealand residing in the United States, against the Republic of Korea. The case was brought before the United Nations International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. L.G. alleges a violation of her rights under articles 2 (1) (c) and (d), 5 and 6 of the Convention. The petitioner claims that the respondent's policy of mandatory medical testing for HIV/AIDS and illegal drugs use before registering as an alien resident is discriminatory and violates her right to equality and non-discrimination.

Procedural History:
The case was submitted to the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination in March 2019. The key parties involved are L.G. as the petitioner and the Republic of Korea as the respondent. The jurisdiction of the case falls under the United Nations International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination.

Legal Analysis and Reasoning:
The petitioner argues that the respondent's policy of mandatory medical testing is discriminatory and violates her rights under the Convention. The respondent, on the other hand, claims that the policy is necessary to ensure the health and moral standards of foreign teachers and to protect the public from the risk of drug addiction and HIV/AIDS transmission. The Committee held that the respondent's policy is a violation of the petitioner's rights under the Convention. The policy was found to be discriminatory and the respondent failed to demonstrate its necessity to achieve its stated goals.

Decisions and Rulings:
The Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination ruled in favor of the petitioner, finding that the respondent's policy of mandatory medical testing is a violation of her rights under the Convention. The Committee ordered the respondent to take all necessary measures to ensure equal and dignified treatment of all foreign English-speaking teachers and to repeal the policy of mandatory medical testing.

Impact and Significance:
The case highlights the issue of discrimination against foreigners in the context of employment, particularly in relation to mandatory medical testing. The ruling emphasizes the importance of ensuring equal treatment and non-discrimination for all individuals, regardless of their nationality or immigration status. It also underscores the need for policies to be grounded in evidence and proportionate to their stated goals, rather than relying on stereotypes or generalizations about certain groups of people.
