Case Details:
Case Name: Mr. K. v. France
Case ID: Communication No. 2221/2011
Court: United Nations Human Rights Committee (UNHRC)
Document Details: Order or Judgment
Date: Not specified

Procedural History:
The case involves a complaint filed by Mr. K. against Renault, a French State-owned railway company, for racial discrimination. The case was brought before the UNHRC by Mr. K. against France, alleging a violation of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (ICERD) by Renault. The UNHRC found the communication admissible and proceeded to consider it on the merits.

Legal Analysis and Reasoning:
The petitioner claimed that he had been subjected to racial discrimination by Renault and requested reclassification and damages. The Committee analyzed the petitioner's claim under article 6 of the Convention, which guarantees the right to an effective remedy against racial discrimination. The Committee found that the State party had violated article 6 of the Convention by failing to provide the petitioner with an effective remedy against the practices constituting racial discrimination, specifically the failure to reclassify him and the dismissal of his appeal in cassation.

Decisions and Rulings:
The UNHRC recommended that the State party ensure that victims of racial discrimination are able to receive full reparation, including through access to available domestic remedies and the examination of all claims involving the determination of what reparation victims are entitled to receive. The Committee also recommended that the reclassification of employees who are the victims of racial discrimination be explicitly taken into account in the assessment of awards of damages.

Impact and Significance:
The case highlights the importance of providing effective remedies for victims of racial discrimination. The decision of the UNHRC emphasizes the obligation of States to ensure that victims of racial discrimination are able to receive full reparation and sets a precedent for future cases involving the reclassification of employees who are victims of racial discrimination.
