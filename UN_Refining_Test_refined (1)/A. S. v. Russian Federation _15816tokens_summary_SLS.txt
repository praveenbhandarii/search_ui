Summary:

Case Details:
The case of A. S. v. Russia (communication No. 45/2012) was brought before the United Nations Committee on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (UNCRPD). A. S., a Russian citizen of Roma ethnicity, alleged a violation by Russia of articles 4, 5, and 6 of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. The alleged victim claimed to be a victim of hate speech and incitement to hatred and discrimination following the distribution of offensive leaflets in the town of Opochka, Pskov region.

Procedural History:
The communication was submitted to the UNCRPD, and the Russian authorities had previously investigated the incident but decided not to initiate criminal proceedings. The investigation primarily focused on identifying the authors of the leaflets rather than addressing the impact on the Roma community. The UNCRPD found that the Russian authorities had failed to adequately protect the alleged victim and the Roma community from hate speech and incitement to hatred and discrimination.

Legal Analysis and Reasoning:
The case highlights the obligations of states parties to protect individuals and communities from hate speech and discrimination. The UNCRPD emphasized that domestic laws and regulations should provide effective protection against such acts. The Russian authorities were found to have not taken appropriate measures to address the situation despite being aware of the offensive leaflets. The case also raises issues related to the right to equal treatment before the courts and the right to an effective remedy for violations of fundamental rights and freedoms.

Decisions and Rulings:
The UNCRPD concluded that the Russian authorities had violated articles 4, 5, and 6 of the Convention by failing to adequately protect the alleged victim and the Roma community. The Committee recommended that Russia launch a new investigation into the incident and provide compensation to the alleged victim. The State party's argument that the petitioner did not have legal standing in the case was not accepted by the Committee.

Impact and Significance:
This case emphasizes the importance of states' obligations to protect individuals from hate speech and discrimination. It also highlights the role of the UNCRPD in monitoring compliance with the Convention and providing redress to victims of racial discrimination. The case has implications for the protection of the rights of minority groups, particularly the Roma community, in Russia. It underscores the need for States to implement and enforce laws that criminalize hate speech and propaganda based on ideas or theories of racial superiority.
