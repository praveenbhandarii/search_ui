Procedural History:
- The petitioner, an Aboriginal Australian man, alleges that the respondent has violated his rights under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights by denying him access to social security benefits.
- The respondent argues that the petitioner has not exhausted domestic remedies and that the petitioner has not provided sufficient evidence to support his claims.

Legal Analysis and Reasoning:
- The Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination held that the petitioner had sufficiently demonstrated that the application of the Social Security Act had a discriminatory effect on Aboriginal Australians, including the petitioner.
- The Committee found that the respondent had not taken into account the differences in life expectancy between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Australians in the design of the social security scheme.
- The Committee further found that the respondent had not shown that the petitioner had access to alternative forms of social security that would ensure equal enjoyment of the rights protected under the Covenant.
- Therefore, the Committee concluded that the respondent had violated the petitioner's rights under articles 5 and 6 of the Convention.

Decisions and Rulings:
- The Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination found that Australia had violated the rights of an Aboriginal Australian man by denying him access to social security benefits.
- The Committee held that the application of the Social Security Act had a discriminatory effect on Aboriginal Australians and that Australia had not demonstrated that the petitioner had access to alternative forms of social security that would ensure equal enjoyment of the rights protected under the Covenant.
